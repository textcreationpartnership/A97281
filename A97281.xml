            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Heat the Water a little above Blood-warm, that is to ſay, between Blood-warm and ſcalding hot, and then, the Malt being in a Maſh-Tub, add ſo much Liquor to it as is ſufficient, juſt to wet it, and this is called Maſhing; then row or ſtir it up very well for half an Hour together,<note place="margin">Obſerve, Some let every Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſtand an Hour on the Grain.</note> till 'tis all mixed in every part; then cover it over cloſe with a Maſhing-cloth; ſtrow it over with freſh Malt, and let it ſtand an Hour and half or two Hours; and then let off, and maſh again with freſh Liquor, and row it up as before, but let it not ſtand above an
<pb facs="tcp:154370:6"/>Hour, and ſo a third time, but then let it not ſtand above half or three quarters of an Hour; ſome will wet their Malt a fourth time, but in my opinion 'tis not fit to ſtill, but only for making ſmall Beer, or being warmed to put on freſh Malt in another Maſhing.</p>
            <p>Now every Wort that comes is pump'd up out of the under Back into the Cooler, there to cool, and then from the Cooler into the Waſh-Backs, and there let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till all the three Worts come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by the way obſerve, thou art neither to hop nor boil thy Wort as for Beer; now when this is down in the Back, add to it of good Yeſt, and work it up as for Ale; now as the Yeſt riſes beat it down again, and keep all the Yeſt in, and let it work 5 or 6 days, in which time 'twill be ripe, which thou may'ſt know by theſe ſigns: 'Twill work it ſelf down again flat, and then the thick Yeſt will ſink to the bottom, and what lies on the top will be a kind of an hoary or yeſty head; and you are to obſerve, That your Waſh muſt neither be ſour nor ſweet, but taken in a medium between both; for then 'twill be moſt profitable for the Diſtiller.</p>
            <p>Now, when you have proceeded thus, pump up the Waſh out of your Back into the Still, and obſerve as you pump, to row
<pb facs="tcp:154370:7"/>or ſtir up all together, that ſo the thick in the bottom may be brought up; the Still may be filled ſomething more than half, or two thirds at the moſt; then clap on your Head, and make a good Fire, until it begins to work; the Head may be put into the Worm, and all luted faſt; and the Still being brought to work, the Fire may be damp'd with wet Sinders, Aſhes, or the like: Now in the firſt Extraction in drawing off your Low-Wines, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, that ſome Malt will at the beginning run off a Can or two of Proof-Spirits, and then it generally runs very long; other Malt will ſometimes run as long, altho' at the beginning not ſo fully proof; now your Low-Wines being all run of, 'tis obſervable they will by lying much better themſelves; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſome clap them in the Sun to ſharpen them, others in a cold Cellar to make them mellow, which indeed ought to lye 10, 15 or 20 days, before you proceed to a ſecond Extraction: now, as they come fine by rectification, into high Spirits, they will loſe by lying.</p>

                  <hi>RULES</hi> to know what Quantities may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from every Quarter of Malt.</head>
               <p>YOu muſt in the firſt place make about 50 Gallons, or ſomething more than
<pb facs="tcp:154370:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>three Barrels of Waſh, and that in the firſt Extraction will make 32, 34, or 36 Gallons of Low-Wines, and theſe Low-Wines, if you let them lye, will in the 2d Extraction make 11 or 12 Gallons of Proof-Spirits, nay, ſome Malt will make 13 Gallons, eſpecially if in the 2d Extraction you add a Can or two of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Still, and ſuch Malt will run two or three Cans, or 7 or 8 Gallons Proof-Spirits, if it be a great Still.</p>
               <p>Thus much <hi>(Eſteemed Friend)</hi> for this part: I ſhall now anſwer what remains, <hi>ſc.</hi> in Page 60. concerning <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> for I ſay, theſe Rules do agree with that Brewing, where I ſay the Wort is not fully rich of the Malt, and therefore to be diſtilled as ſoon as 'tis well wrought; but if it is to be made into very ſtrong Beer, then it muſt be boil'd and hopp'd, and lye to ſtale, the longer the better, ſo it keeps its body: For this reaſon ſtale Beer, Cyder, old <hi>French</hi> Wine and <hi>Rheniſh,</hi> are at all times fit to be work'd. And again, Concerning the <hi>Dutch</hi> way of Maſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Pag. 61, 62. I ſay,
'tis the moſt advantagious way, with this Proviſo, that you prevent the Low-Wines from a tangue or the Still being burn'd, by drawing of the Liquors, knowing the uſe of a Preſs, which will bring forth all the ſubſtance. And again, What you query
<pb facs="tcp:154370:8"/>in Page 64. concerning Honey, Sugar, and Moloſſus, the quantity of the Water there is an Error in the Preſs, as you may ſee in the <hi>Errata;</hi> for it muſt be 34 or 40 Gallons of Water at the leaſt to that weight; and the Water being made a little above Blood-warm it muſt be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and well united together; and being diſſolv'd, add your Ferment, and work as the Book directs. <hi>Glauber</hi> adviſes a ſixth, ſeventh or eighth part of Water; but I ſay, that is too much; for it will not yield ſo large a quantity of Spirits; but he ſays, it makes it the more grateful. But the other way you may have 10 or 11 Gallons of Proof-Spirits from 100 weight of Moloſſus.</p>
               <p>Now as you deſire to know when for certain Spirits are fermented, take this rule: Take three or four ſpoonfuls in a little Diſh in the left-hand, and a Candle in the right, and throw the Liquor in the Diſh on the Still-head, being hot, and what runs down clap the Candle to, and if it burns, 'tis well wrought, but if it burns not, and clings clammy to the Hand like ſweet Wort, then is it not fit for ſtilling until better fermented.</p>
               <p>Now what you query concerning Backs going backward, and not kindly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting; how to raiſe it again, I know no better thing than hot Liquors and new
<pb facs="tcp:154370:8"/>Ferment, ſometimes adding either Rheniſh Lees, Tartar, or a ſtone or two of <hi>Calx vive</hi> Muſtard, Rape, French Sweets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we have ſpoke in the Book. Thus much ſhall ſuffice concerning the firſt and ſecond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, we ſhall now proceed to the third, call'd <hi>Rectification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed Rectification is that on which the whole of our Art depends, and about which there is ſo great a Noiſe made in the Town, and he that doth perform it beſt muſt needs be the beſt Artiſt. Now we ſay, that the whole Art of Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſteth in bereaving every Spirit from its external Sulphur, and reducing it to its <hi>Vita media,</hi> or middle Life, a middle Nature being introduced, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizating it ſo that of Brandy; which to perform, ſome rectifie from Bay-Salt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the Lees of Wine or Cyder, with addition of Clary, Orrice or Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch a quantity as only to give it a tangue or flavor, and every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction they add a pretty quantity of Water into the Still, the more to mellow and fine the Spirits; and having brought them to fine Wares, they may be allay'd by Water or Liquors to proof. Now 'tis obſervable, that moſt or all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are of that nature, as to return to their old Friend, Mr. Hogo, if they lye long, as the Wares about Town do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:154370:9"/>manifeſt, let them be ever ſo highly drawn; and therefore there is no other way, but to perform it by ſuch things, as by their homogeneous Nature will lye and mellow and exalt the Liquors; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we ſhall treat of more at large, for your ſatisfaction, in our Second Part, as it paſſes the Preſs. So in the mean while, deſiring your acceptance of this at preſent, I remain Your's at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in all that is agreeable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service:</p>

            <p>Therefore 'tis moſtly requiſite for every Artiſt, that bends his Wit to the ſtudy of true Philoſophy, to conſider and endeavour to comprehend the nature of things as they are; and as they originally received their impreſſed forms, as 'twas ſtamped on them by the great Creator, and how they flowed into the Elementary World, where the bleſſing of multiplication was given, by means of a Seed to that end incl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſed in them, and an irrevocable law eſtabliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> that every thing was to multiply in its kind; for although the providence of God was ſuch, that the multiplication ſhould proceed from the general Spirit, yet it was ſo ordained, that the determination of the ſame ſhould be by particular forms; this great truth is plainly to be diſcerned, as the Spirit floweth and paſſeth through the Ocean of the great World, and every part thereof; for certain therefore man being a little World, and (as I may ſay) Lord of the Creation, it was ſo preordain'd, that this noble Creature ſhould receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:154370:11"/>and benefit thereof in ſome degree or other.</p>
            <p>For 'tis to be obſerv'd, that when the Microcoſmical. World was finiſh'd, and the Bl ſſing of Multiplication given to all things in their kind, (as before ſaid) at the cloſe of all man was made, a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmical one, an abſtract and emblem of all the works of Wonder, and as he was created in a degree, ſurpaſſing other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo had he degrees of Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him equal thereunto; for he was not only made Lord of the Creation, but alſo was placed in the ſuperior Theatre thereof, <hi>viz,</hi> In the Garden which the Lord God had planted Eaſtward in <hi>Eden, Gen. 2. v. 8.</hi> and <hi>v. 16.</hi> the Lord God commanded him, ſaying, <hi>Of every Tree of the Garden thou may'ſt freely Eat, except of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil;</hi> that was the forbidden fruit, for doubtleſs this Tree being adorn'd with ſo much Beauty, and pleaſantneſs, was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as an object, to ſee if man would trangreſs againſt his Creator for fading, Shadowy delights, which could produce no other covering but Fig leaves, with which too too many in this age are covered.</p>
            <p>'Tis very obſervable, that our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb facs="tcp:154370:12"/>were no ſooner beguiled by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's ſubtilty and pleaſantneſs of the Fruit, but they found by experience, that this Fruit of Diſobedience, which they had Eaten, was tinctur'd with death; for as they were in a ſtate of Innocency, and in the favour and preſence of God, ſo on the contrary they became in a ſtate deplorable; for the wrathfull Fire ſtirs up immediately Horrors, Fears, and dreadfull Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hearing the voice of God, were afraid, and hid themſelves from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and although a general Woe was pronounced unto the whole Creation for Man's tranſgreſſion, yet the All-mercifull God provides for Man a fountain and ſtream of Love, which by their Virtue was to extinguiſh this wrathfull Fire; for Chriſt is promiſed in theſe words, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Womans Seed ſhall break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head,</hi> and many are living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the bleſſed full-fillings hereof, which, as it floweth forth in its univerſal operation is to kindle in the boſom of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, principles and practices, agreeable to its divine Nature; for ſuch that are thus truly awakened, breath unto the Lord, and travail in Spirit, with this earneſt deſire, that all their Species may
<pb facs="tcp:154370:12"/>have the benefit thereof, as knowing that Grace is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and extends to all that will receive the ingraffed Word, which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is able to Save to the utmoſt; therefore, O Man, if thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf, as the Scripture ſaith; for 'twas evident, that our firſt Parents did not only looſe the Preſence and Favour of God by tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but alſo were driven out from their Habitation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and a flaming Sword was ſet on the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub, turning overy way to preſerve the Tree of Life; for thus much I will affirm, that the Fruit thereof belongs not to ſuch that are in the ſtate of Diſobedience. Now Man having loſt his greateſt Dignity, I ſhall conſider him, and his Office, as he is placed in the great field of Nature, ſtating in ſome degree, the difference between the Original and fallen State, as may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned in theſe three Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'tis to be conſider'd, that <hi>Adam</hi> (who was the Father of all Mankind) was as the Names imports, created of a red quinteſſential Earth, yea, in the very Image of God, and was endued with ſuch Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he knowing the Nature was able to give a Name to all things, and as
<pb facs="tcp:154370:13"/>it had a ſymbolizing Harmony to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or particular Forms, and as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical Power had its degree of Purity on the ſpecificating Sulphurs, or as they were more interwoven with emerged cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, ſo were they named; let it be how it will, 'tis plain, that the Beaſts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air were brought unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſee what be would call them; and whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> called every living Creature, that was the name thereof; for doubtleſs in this State he had all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e advantages of beholding the ſame in the great Looking-glaſs of Nature, or that Globe of Wiſdom, wheron the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Miſteries did more on its Axis, by the reſplendant Rays of Light, which give ſound Judgment, and opens the Nature of created Beings as they are, and ſhews general Science; for that in this vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Garden, the univerſal Spirit muſt abundantly flow, even the firſt Ens of that which ſupplies the great Fabrick of the World; and every individual part of the ſame: For as the Learned, and truly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſay, that every Atom is a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmical Globe, and internally contains ſome Eſſential Idea's of a Paradyſſical Purity, and Man, Lord of all, who was
<pb facs="tcp:154370:13"/>created in the Image of God, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Superiority to Rule, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Wiſdom to know things, as they primitively were; ſuch was the Dignity of Man in his Office in a Primitive State; but in a Fall it State, Man is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend nothing aright; for his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is become darkned, being blinded by the God of this World, running only after the carnal Imaginations of their own Hearts, which are filled with Vanity, Pride and Self-conceit, living in a fading and tranſitory World, ſubjected to Fears, Agonies, yea, Griefs and Sorrows, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, Wants and Diſeaſes, and in fine, Death it ſelf, which makes a change be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pure and the Corrupted, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prepare him for another more laſting Poſſeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'tis to be obſerved, that Man was placed in the Garden Eaſtward in <hi>Eden,</hi> to dreſs and to keep it, this was the excellent Office of Man in the ſtate of Innocency, when all things that were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the great God, were very good, which is abundantly more Superior then that which he is now in; for he was put forth is Till the Ground, which hath received the effect of the Curſe for Man's ſake:
<pb facs="tcp:154370:14"/>For the Earth was to bring forth Thorns and Thiſtles; and as Man was there to eat of every Tree of the Garden <hi>(the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil only excepted)</hi> freely; now muſt he eat his Bread by the ſweat of his Brows, and exceeding hard Labour; for why, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is more thickly cover'd over with the vail of Corruption, which doth ſtand abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more in need of a Help-mate, than primitively it did, ſo if Man's Office, as it is to be a Help-Mate to Nature, ſo doth it require more pains and Induſtry to perform the ſame: For although this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (Gods Handmaid) doth flow forth in her vivifying Power, yet things could never be brought to any true degree of Perfection, much leſs to any beautiful Form, without the help of Man, as plain to be diſcerned, in the fruitfulneſs of a well inhabited Land, and the barrenneſs of thoſe that are not ſo; Nature therefore now ſtands in perfect neceſſity to be helped forward by the excellent Artificer, Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for now 'tis not only to be dreſſed and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſuperfluities to be removed out of the way; but alſo there muſt be Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Tilling the Ground, Manuring and Setting with great diligence, if ever
<pb facs="tcp:154370:14"/>he deſigns to exalt the Beauty and Form of her appearance to any degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs, it muſt be by a continual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ordering thereof: The truth of what is here ſaid, is known to every Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer and Gardiner, and ſuch other Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, that do induſtriouſly improve their Fields to the greateſt advantage; and here ſome Mens excellency out-does others, as may be ſeen by many examples in their improvements; but ſtill all this muſt be perform'd with abundance of more pains and labour, than originally they were.</p>
            <p>A Third Obſervation is, ſeeing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Man was ſuch, as to be adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, to know things in their Primitive ſtate as they were; ſo now he is deprived of the ſame, and 'tis impoſſible for him to arrive to any degree of Perfection therein, either to rule or diſpence aright of his Office, except he ask it of the Lord, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to rule the Kingdom of his Father, that it might be for the Glory of God, by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and adjuſting things according to the ballance of Truth, ſound Reaſon, and firm Judgment, this was ſo acceptable to the Lord, although his Petition was great, yet
<pb facs="tcp:154370:15"/>that he asked was ſmall, in compariſon to what the Lord beſtowed on him; for to him was not only given Wiſdom, but Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honour, and Length of days, and in ſo great Superiority to others, that there was none, either before or after him, that were to be compared to him; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his right asking: Now, this <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Writings, prefers Wiſdom before any other Gift; for he ſays, <hi>That all things are but dung and droſs in compariſon of it,</hi> and O Man! One of the principal Seals of Wiſdom, is to know thy ſelf aright, and in doing that thou wilt know from what thou waſt Created, and for what end; thou wilt alſo know the difference between the Primitive and Fall'n State; alſo by what Power thou art upheld, and from whence Wiſdom muſt proceed, and what that Power is, that flows into the Center of thy Soul, that carries a tranſmuting Power with it, of changing the vileſt of Sinners into the beſt of Saints, and in knowing this, thou wilt certainly know thy Office and Power, and what Degrees and Meaſures are ſo to be taken in thy exerciſe thereof; for now thou wilt know the right uſe of the Creatures, and in ſuch a way, that God may be
<pb facs="tcp:154370:15"/>Glorified: For as the Apoſtle ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch, <hi>The recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was before their Eyes, looking towards a City, which was not made with hands, but the builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof was the Lord;</hi> they know that in all ſtates, Man hath the excellent Principle of Immortality in the Synterri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of his Fabrick, which was to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd from thence, and to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her Deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will cauſe every Man to conſider with himſelf, how he may walk, ſo as to walk aright, <hi>For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom, and to harken unto Truth, that is Underſtanding;</hi> therefore I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that every Man might know the ſtation the Lord hath placed him in, and how to improve his Talent aright, for we are not to be like the ſlothful ſervant, that tyed up his Talent in a Napkin, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it in the earth, and when the Lord examined the reaſon thereof, he complains that he was a hard Maſter; but this I can teſtifie, that God requires of no Man more than he hath given him: For where much is given, much is required; ſome had five, ſome ten, and others fifty, here
<pb facs="tcp:154370:16"/>the improvement was to be according to the principles; for the right uſe of five Talents had the ſame reward as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of fifty; for the Widows mite mention'd in the Goſpel was accepted by the Lord; as a deed of great importance, for that ſhe had caſt in her all.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall examine by what hath been ſaid, how the Inhabitants of this Land do proceed in improving their Talent, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the great and manifold mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them; In our opinion the returns are very ſmall; for very few there be (in compariſon to the multitude) that are found, that do rightly conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mercies beſtowed on them; but on the contrary are ſwollow'd up (as I may ſay) in the exceſs of abomination, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is ſuch, that they turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, as is too too evidently ſeen by the grand debaucheries this Age aboundeth with; for the Sons and Daughters of Men delights too too much to inhabit the wrathful ſphere, and from thence ſend forth principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces agreeable to ſuch a Nature, for they are not ſatisfy'd in their negligence in giving their obedience to the word of God, but daily ſtart up new Atheiſm and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb facs="tcp:154370:16"/>Doctrines to plead for and maintain their damnable luſt, which indeed flows into the Pit of Deſtruction, theſe have the Auſtere and Luſtfull principles ſo kindled by their intemperance, that there ambition is ſuch that they luſt at all; and are never ſatisfy'd without they could enlarge their Tents and Borders to the greateſt of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, they are for building and enlarging their Barns and Store houſes, which points forth the end of their deſire, which can be nothing but to Eat and Drink and be merry, and enjoy themſelves in the pomps and pleaſures of this World; but let them remember what was ſaid to one in the Goſpel, <hi>Thou Fool this very Night thou muſt or ſhall dye,</hi> and it may be in his Sins too; and what muſt be his portion, ſeeing there is a Woe pronounced againſt ſuch that dye in their Sins, and 'tis a very hainous one not to uſe the mercies of God aright; for that which was deſign'd to them as a Bleſſing they turn to a Curſe, and thus are guilty of depriving their ſelves of the great benefits, deſign'd by the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull God for their Temporal and Eternal Welfares, and ſo may expect at the final end, the dreadful Sentence of Depart from me ye workers of Iniquity, and the Body,
<pb facs="tcp:154370:17"/>Soul, and Spirit, as they riſe again, to be eaſt into the wrathfull Fire, there for ever to remain, for as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>the Worm never dies, nor doth the Fire go out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore while ye have time prize it, and eſteem not the Shadowy Fig leaves, beyond the covering of God's Spirit, nor the forbidden Fruit more than obedience to God's Command; for who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly looſe the comfort of a matchleſs Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, for a dreadful portion amongſt Dogs and Sorcerers, without the Walls of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City, which every true Chriſtian both Man and Woman ought to labour to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from; ſo indeed ought all ſo to do by Temperance, Humility, Faſting and Prayer, and by a ſtedfaſt Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whoſe merits, and by the blood of the Covenant, we are ſo bountifully redeemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus much for ſuch general Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; I ſhall now come to lay down ſome Benefits as they ariſe from Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and other diſadvantages that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the neglect hereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the benefits that proceed from Temperance are many and wonderful, as may be in part diſcern'd from what hath been already ſaid; for then the body is
<pb facs="tcp:154370:17"/>more free, and the judgment more ſound to diſcern things aright, for the illuminating Spirit acts moſt freely in pure Tabernacles, for as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that choſen Prophet of God laid down Temperance through his Four Books, as a main hinge of Salvation; 'tis the very ſame in the great World, for a Temperate Seaſon makes a Fruitfull Harveſt, and in ſome ſence the whole Creation ſtands in an Harmony, both in the greater and leſſer World, having a Sympathy and Fellow-feeling together; ſo that, if any one part rejoyce or ſuffer, as 'tis a member of the great body that will feel of the effect.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſo as really it is, why ſhould not Temperance be obſerved in the right and moderate uſe of the Creature, by which means health is wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and long Life expected; for why the Spirits, or the Chariots of Life being kept brisk, ſerene or free, and not burned with ſtupifying and obnoxious Vapours, retain their power in preſerving the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a due and equal Temperature; thence the Archeius and internal fire have power Spagirically to exereiſe the office in diſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ution, fermentation, ſeperation, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, diſtillation, exaltation, digeſtion,
<pb facs="tcp:154370:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>and maturation of the alimentary parts, by which the fabrick of the body is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in all its parts, and maintain'd in due decorum; nay by this means the Spirit, Soul and Body are ſtrengthned, the mind ſo fitted and qualify'd, as to ſearch into the moſt obſtruce Secrets of Nature, and ſuch by conſequence may ſooner expect to obtain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Science than others, and underſtand what is delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the original Chaos, <hi>viz. In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth, and the Earth was without form and void, and darkneſs was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> with a <hi>lux fiat,</hi> which ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims its embaſſage, and ſeparated all the diſtinct natures that lay unfruitfully hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Pavillions of Confuſion, ſuch was the activity of the All ſearching Spirit of God, as to exalt from thence a World of ſubſtantial Harmony, adorning every part with unexpreſſable beauty; from which words it is plain to be conceived, that the Original of all things was a Chaos, void and without form, yee, a confuſed Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Water, which was potentially all things, yet actually nothing; from whence
<pb facs="tcp:154370:18"/>did not only proceed the World (as is ſaid) but alſo that Fountain and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Spirit, which preſerveth, nouriſheth and maintaineth, multiplying and ſuccouring being; to this very day from hence alſo proceedeth by the Fire of Conflagration the Chaos Magical, the true Exaltation of which, is the greateſt of Spagirical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that ever the great God revealed to mankind: For out of that proceeds not only the Authors <hi>Sal Panariſtos,</hi> but alſo <hi>Paracelſus's Sal Enixum,</hi> and the <hi>Sal Mirabilis</hi> of the wiſe, together with the Liquor <hi>Alkaeſt,</hi> and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Mercury of the Philoſophers, with their <hi>Aurum potibile,</hi> and grand <hi>Panacea;</hi> as alſo the perpetual lights of the <hi>Magi,</hi> with their Malleable Glaſs, their Tyron purple, and Crimſon dye, and other ſuch like Myſteries, which are only ordain'd for the wiſe in heart to enjoy: For ſuch, by their temperate Life, are not only fitted for a ſearch, but alſo when obtain'd, know how to make a right uſe thereof; and for their reward, they have not only Wiſdom, but alſo Riches, Honour and length of days; ſo that Temperance is a virtue highly to be eſteem'd of, ſeeing it is an inlet to many others, and ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:154370:19"/>will produce the moſt bleſſed Fruits that are to be enjoy'd on this ſide Immortality; therefore recommended to all as a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel, which if received and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, that will find the wonderfull and effectual Virtues thereof; and thus I ſhall conclude Temperance to be the cauſe of much good.</p>
            <p>Now as to Intemperance, it is on the other hand the cauſe of as many Evills; For we ſee by experience, that the Glutton never eſteems the Benefies that proceed from Temperance, for that he is never ſo well ſatisfied, as when he is gormondiſing himſelf, making his Belly his God, as I may truly call it, for that he riſeth in the Morning, and ſcarce ever ceaſeth lifting his Hand to his Mouth, untill he hath made himſelf drunk, and abſorb'd all his Faculties in the exceſs of the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Beſtial nature; nay, worſe than the Beaſt of the Field, for they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end of the Creation, taking that in Nature which is ſufficient for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; their general ſauce that agitates them is the penetrating power of the Air; they commonly have no other Bed but Earth, or Canopy but Heaven, when as the ſenſual Glutton hath all that is needfull,
<pb facs="tcp:154370:19"/>even to a Superfluity, he lies upon his Couches of Ivory, and Beds of Delight, and heeds not Mercy, and is unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his fellow Creatures, even the cries of poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which would accept of the Crumbs that fall from his Table, and lies at his Gates, the Dogs licking his Sores till he died: The cruelty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs of this Intemperance is ſo abominable, that I want place to reſent it, therefore ſhall paſs it by here, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to their conſideration, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the future Eſtate of theſe Two; <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried by the good Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; But <hi>Dives</hi> by the evil, into Hell to be tormented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there is another ſort of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which in ſome ſence may be ſaid to be like that of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> The Miſer's Intemperance, which is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Money his God, caring not how he pines his Body, ſo that he may be rich, nor who he deſtroys, ſo that he may but attain his end, he will gripe it in with a thouſand Lies, taking all advantages, catching and over reaching, and out-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by circumventing Bargains, yet will wipe his Mouth with this, That he is a wiſe Dealer, and that theſe are lawful
<pb facs="tcp:154370:20"/>Profits, and certainly the Bleſſing of God attends, becauſe he is ſo rich; and ſo calls Riches that are gotten by ſuch abominable ways, God's Bleſſings, and will further conclude, that conſequently he muſt be the Servant of God, when, alas he is a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave to Satan, who hath lull'd him aſleep, and thus puff'd him up with Pride, which cauſes him to deſpiſe his Fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are not of the ſame Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with him, let their acquirements be what they will, they are eſteem'd not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Converſe; and if they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in their Spirits, through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Care that attend this Life, ſo, as to cauſe ſome various changes in their Actions, then for certain they are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be Ideots, Maggots, or ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fellows, that have committed ſome ſecret and hainous Sins, for which they are attended with ſuch Internal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgments; but I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to let ſuch raſh Judgers know, that they may for certain be miſtaken for all this; for as the Scripture ſays, <hi>Whom God loveth he chaſtiſeth;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was good for him that he was afflicted, for before he was afflicted he went aſtray;</hi> and the Goſpel Commands
<pb facs="tcp:154370:20"/>are, <hi>That we ſhould hoard in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, where neither Moth nor Ruſt can corrupt;</hi> for 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable to us, that the Devil often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares thoſe that are rich, and cauſes them to doubt, as the young Man in the Goſpel did, and therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>'Tis eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> becauſe their Minds are ſo much on their Poſſeſſions; And again, I remember the Devil lays claim to them; for when he took Chriſt up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhew'd him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the Glories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſaid, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me,</hi> &amp;c. — But leſt ſome ſhould make this Objection, and ſay, <hi>The Devil was a Lyar from the beginning, in pretending to that he hath no right to:</hi> In anſwer to which, although we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to be ſo, yet we have infallible Truths which demonſtrate Riches to be ſuch Objects, that hinder the Creature many times from preſſing Eternity-ward, and ſwallow them up in the Delights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; this kind of Intempeance is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:154370:21"/>attended with a Brother of the ſame kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetouſneſs, which in this place I ſhall explain to be a long Eye to other Mens Eſtates, Goods, Knowledge, or Art, and will undertake many ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter practiſes, and gilded pretences, the better to accompliſh their end, they are pretendedly circumſpect in their Words and Actions, covering their Hypocriſie with the external Garments of Religion; but if they cannot get their ends fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, they will ſoon manifeſt their bare Skin, and will either gratifie thee for what thou haſt done, with a pretended ſcorn of Mumchancy's ſilence, or elſe they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully tell thee, that they are not ſo fond of thy acquaintance, as thou mayſt think of, without they could get more by it; but let ſuch know, that we are able to diſcern in the Forehead the Beaſts marks, principally Two, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetouſneſs and Ingratitude, which is equal to the ſin of Witcheraft.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is an Intemperance, which involves in ſin all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Vain Glory, and to maintain the ſame, they run into ſuch Notions and Doctrines, which have no harmony with ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Law of Nature, or written Word
<pb facs="tcp:154370:21"/>of God. Now theſe are ſuch Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, as take off the Crown of Glory from their own heads, and cauſe them to looſe their dignity to rule as Man, and deprives them of Wiſdom and true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, even as I may truly ſay of that rational part, given him by the Creator of Nature, and would eaſily diſcover to them that they are riding in Chariots of Death, driving <hi>John</hi> like to the Pit of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for Intemperance produceth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and Diſeaſes are part of the effects of the Curſe, and being death's Meſſenger, or as Arrows ſent from the Almighty; for not uſing the Mercies here beſtowed aright; but there is a Tophet prepared of old, for ſuch as turn Bleſſings into a Curſe, and for ſelf-Murtherers, and for giddy high minded, diſobedient to Parents, and for ſuch as diſhonour God and his Holy Word.</p>
            <p>Such are become the crying and heinous Sins of this Age, and it hath ſo excited the wrathful principle cauſing a Centrall action on too too
<pb facs="tcp:154370:22"/>many in this generation, who are like immature Fruit fallen from the Tree, that before they are ripe they are half rotten: for Intemperance blows up the black Coal of Death, that would extinguiſh the Fuel of the Lamp, before the natural pondus of the Oyl is exhauſted, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not immediately or ſo ſuddenly affected in all alike, yet at the beſt it will cauſe it to burn with ſo much fury and exhalation of corrupted fumes, as to ſlain the vital and ſanguifying Spirit, thence nature comes to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus (Reader) as Temperance is the cauſe of much good, ſo is Intemperance the Original of many Evils; Now as the learned Phyſitians ſay, the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, and ſuitable means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, then there may be expected a ſucceſsfull Event to follow: Thus much for the virtue and vice of Temperance and Intemperance, which I ſhall deſiſt from here, and ſo ſhall proceed on by way of obſervation concerning the right uſe of Foreign Growths, and alſo the Nature of our own.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, the all-wiſe Creator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceptions created all things for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Service of Man, and gave him Wiſdom to compreheud the ſame, placing a free will in him as to their uſe, which ought to be aright, which I ſhall here in great meaſure ſhew for information of ſuch, as as are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come ſhort of this point; then they are thus to conceive, that every Climate produceth ſome different effects,
<pb facs="tcp:154370:23"/>from that of another, whether it be from the heat of the Elivation of the Sun, or Coldneſs from its depreſſion, or as the Climates have adherence to the torrid, temperate or frigid <hi>Zones:</hi> for although the general Spirit that nouriſheth all things is one, yet diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects is worked on it, by the various forms that every Matrix con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for the ſpecification of Seed, which may in great meaſure be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by this following Example. Man the three various ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Tawny, and Black, are all one in Species or kind, yet very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in form and nature, of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Principles, for ſome are more Hot, and others more Cold, according as the internal Sulphur is exalted by degrees by the external heat of the Sun: for the torrid Zone cauſes great heat and dryneſs, deſtroying the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum inatum,</hi> and therefore ſcarcely Habitable; the frigid Zones obſtructs the Circulation of moiſture by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent congelation of Cold; the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Zones have an unity of heat and moiſture, and therefore moſtly
<pb facs="tcp:154370:23"/>Inhabited: and all the different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that proceed from the different Climates, let them be Animals, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables or Minerals; and although of one kind, yet in Operation do they produce different effects, the knowledge of which is that alone which qualifies a Phyſician; and although this is of ſo great importance, yet few there be, that conſider it aright; for the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of which I will inſtance ſuch Druggs and Simples, as are commonly adminiſter'd, ſo by experience, we know their Nature and different Operation; Inſtance <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> in <hi>China, Turky, Pontus,</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> have all ſome different effects, for the choiceſt of all is <hi>China,</hi> yet all theſe Foreign <hi>Rhubarbs</hi> from their inate heat will work in half the quantity upon the Engliſh conſtitutions, to that of Monks, or others of our own Growth; for where the affinity is moſt, the Operation is leaſt viſible; ſomethings are ſo averſe in qualities, that although they may be Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the Inhabitants of the Land wherein they grow, yet deſtructive to
<pb facs="tcp:154370:24"/>thoſe of another; for the difference of Climates produces different Effects, as hath been before ſaid. Thus the <hi>Turkiſh Opium</hi> is natural to the <hi>Turky</hi> Natives, and they are wont to feed upon it, eſteeming it as the moſt Balſamick Concret, a Juice that will maintain their Faculties in ſuch a vigorous Agility, that 'tis affirm'd to give them ſtrength and courage; nay they delight ſo much therein, that 'tis ſaid they are wont to debauch themſelves therewith; but whether it is ſo or not I ſhall leave and paſs on to that which we know by Experience, That is, the <hi>Turk</hi> being deprived of the uſe of it, they dye ſooner, and droop more from its loſs, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they do, when ſtinch'd to half their uſual quantity of Food; yet how wonderfull different is the Operation of it on Engliſh Bodies, and what ſtupendious effects does it work; for Twenty, nay ſometimes Ten Grains, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſufficient to cauſe an Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to doze his laſt, like as a Mortal Poyſon; but 'tis clear from what hath been ſaid, that in its
<pb facs="tcp:154370:24"/>Centre it is not ſuch, but only works this effect upon Colder Natures, by the activity of the warmth of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sulphur, which ſends forth the Vapour. Now this thing cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from Engliſh <hi>Poppys,</hi> although 'tis a kind of <hi>Opium:</hi> The ſame thing is to be underſtood by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent products of Wine, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> from thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and theſe from thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> for the hotter the Sun is, the more is the Fruit maturated, and dilated, from hence it is that Rich and Luſcious Wines admit of no Argell.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis plain to be conceived, that the all wiſe God hath caus'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Land to bring forth ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, as be moſt ſuitable for its own Inhabitants; therefore as <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> ſaith, <hi>'Tis a meer dotage and careleſneſs in a Phyſitian, to neglect being a perfect one in his own Nation;</hi> that is, by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he is to know the Nature and Virtue of thoſe Minerals, Vegitables
<pb facs="tcp:154370:25"/>and Animals, which its own Archeius affordeth, which is ſufficient for a true Operator in Phyſick; eſpecially if they know the Nature of the <hi>Sal Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis,</hi> and Dalitate of Natare, in its fermentative Vertue,</p>
            <p>But for encouraging that Traffick, which imploys thouſands in great Proſperity, and without which a Land would ſoon groan, as we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; we ſhall ſtate ſome rules from whence may be conceiv'd the right uſe of Foreign Growths, as they are brought to us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thou art to know, that 'tis heat that makes a perfection and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation of perfect bodies; for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, There is abundance of the Sperm Powder of Gold in <hi>England;</hi> but the Climate is too cold to bring matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Air, being more Crude, Groſs and Impure in cold Countries than in hot: we have many Examples of this by the maturity and immaturity of fruits; for as <hi>Sandivogius</hi> ſaith, The <hi>Orange-Trees</hi> in <hi>Polonia</hi> grow
<pb facs="tcp:154370:25"/>like other Trees, as alſo in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elſwhere, where this Native ſoil is, and yield any Fruit, becauſe they are oppreſſed with cold; but if at any time Nature be wittily and ſweetly help'd, then may Art perfect what Nature could not; ſo that where-ever the Fruit of any Country hath the full Rays of the Sun, there the fruit is more mature and ripe, ſo that the leſſer quantity of it will ſuſtain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially of thoſe that live in colder Climates, for ſhould ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to Eat or Drink it in as large quantities, as thoſe of the ſame Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate do, 'twould prove diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them; for a great Fire ſoon extinguiſhes a ſmall one; and although the Philoſopher's Tincture is a <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> againſt all Deſeaſes; yet as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divogius</hi> ſaith, Many of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have deſtroy'd themſelves, by not knowing the right uſe thereof; ſo is it in this very caſe, for the more ſubtil any fruit is, the leſſer quantity doth ſuffice; now
'tis warmth only that cauſeth ſubtilty: For we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="tcp:154370:26"/>that Fruits of colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates may be taken in the largeſt quantities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe may be obſerved as general Rules, until I ſhall enlarge more on them, which doubtleſs will be in other Volumes, Written by this Author, for that purpoſe, and in the mean while, he knows that the careful Obſervers will conceive his Mind by what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done; I ſhall therefore conclude with this, concerning the uſe of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Growths, and ſo proceed to give ſome wholſome Directions, concerning the Growths and Products of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and its Neighboring Country <hi>England;</hi> 'Twas chiefly for this end the Book was Written, as may be diſcern'd by theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Reaſon obliging me to write this Book, was to let the Induſtrious know, that there are Wines and Vinor Spirits to be made out of all ſorts of Growths, as will
<pb facs="tcp:154370:26"/>be delivered in the enſuing Treatiſe, and principally from Apples, Pears, Peaches, Plums, Apricocks, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Rasberries, Goosberries, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, the Taſte of theſe Wines may be alter'd and exalted by the Signature of ſeveral Herbs, and by conſequence, many Artificial Wines may be made, and brought to ſhew forth ſome excellent Virtue, which may be yet more and more advanced by the Noble ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Sulphurs, or Balſamick Oils, ſo prepared as to be fermented in; but this being a Spagirick Operation, together with the Eſſence of Wine, and the Eſſential Salts, and my high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>cticable, to the great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Land, and diſhonour of the Authors thereof: In Fine, for the prevention of all this, and much more (that might be ſaid) of this Nature: I have proceeded in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this new Art of making Wines, according to the Rules and Method obſerved by the Wiſe Schoolmaſter, in Teaching his young Scholar the firſt beginning with <hi>A. B. C.</hi> and thence gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb facs="tcp:154370:27"/>proceeding, until they are able Gramatically to demonſtrate the root of Languages; And althô this was originally but as a Mite in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or as an early born Babe, juſt able to ſpeak the innocent Language, yet 'tis now ſo nouriſhed up, that it may be ſaid to be grown up to a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtature in Art; and I am reſolved to continue my favourable Aſpect to it, ſo as to make it become ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its choiceſt Friends.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O ye Nobles and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> World, I thought it convenient to let the excellent Spirit amongſt you know, that we highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of your encouraging uſeful Arts, which may be yet in a far higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree perform'd, than hitherto; becauſe your Land doth ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:154370:28"/>of the Mineral Kingdom, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Monarchy, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have written of. As to the Woollen Manufacturage, it helps to cloath the Inhabitants of other Lands. As to the Linen Manufacturage eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Parliament, ſince my laſt Impreſſion, under ſo honourable a Title, gaves me great ſatisfaction, ſince it is ſo induſtriouſly encouraged, I can ſuppoſe no other, but that it will ſo flouriſh, as to abound. As to Food, it is with ſuch great variety of Diſhes, as is not only ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, but alſo pleaſingly, to anſwer the greateſt Curioſity, that the moſt difficult Palates may modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: The like is to be underſtood concerning Wines and other Liquors, which might be brought to a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance, and the more eſpecially, if the almoſt Sacred Law of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance was but duly regarded.</p>
            <p>A Second Reaſon that obliged me, was, That although there was vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books of Diſtillation extant, yet
<pb facs="tcp:154370:28"/>they are now of little ſervice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Baſis they went on is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and the Conſtitution of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation is ſo altered by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no Wares are to be made or Sold, but what is Diſtilled from ſound Grain; I have therefore offered to the Induſtrious and honeſt Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome Conſiderations concerning the encouraging and erecting of a Brandy Manufacturage here in <hi>England,</hi> and by ſuch Manudactions we ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to ſupply our Defects at home, but alſo upon ſuch good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous grounds, that our Wares may become vendible in other Lands, to the great advancement of our own, and then we might in time expect the waſt, and Forreſts, and Hills, to be couverted into fenced Fields, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Gardens, filled with all ſuch ſort of Growths, <hi>viz.</hi> Orchards, Vineyards, Flax and Hemp Fields, according as the natural Soil will beſt bring forth; by this means many thouſands of the Poor might be ſo employ'd as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form therefrom a much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="tcp:154370:29"/>ſubſtance than otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe and ſuch like reaſons was this Book Printed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taken a part from my <hi>Chymicus Rationalis,</hi> which was compoſed from my ſerious review of that Art, which way in time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſee the Light; Therefore I thought it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> convenient to let the Reader know, that as I have come amongſt the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Art, and ingenious Men; ſo that Diſcourſe of things of this kind have happen'd; that ſome have been very d ſirous, that I would firſt in plain words communicate to them the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:154370:29"/>hundredth part of the Deſires of Things of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Therefore as 'tis generally Publiſh'd, ſo I hope 'twill accordingly be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing I recommend not ſo much my ſelf, as thoſe practical Eſſays, in making Artificial Wines from thoſe Growths, which to our Knowledge, was ſo fully demonſtrated before; and if they were, it makes nothing againſt this, ſeeing it is ſo generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that there is nothing ſo well done, but ſomething may be added to it, in any Art or Science, and more eſpecially in this of Man's Office in the great Field of Nature; which if promoted in an acceptable way, I have my deſir'd Recompence, and I ſhall labour in my Day and Time, to be as ſerviceable (as in me lies,) to the Sons of Men; In the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which, I ſhall conclude this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, Subſcribing my Self a Friend and Lover of all Induſtrious Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Art, under what denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever.

               <p>NOW as to what concerns the <hi>Vitis</hi> or <hi>Vine,</hi> we ſhall briofly but candidly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; Firſt as to the Soyle that agrees moſt to the Vine, is of a nitrous and ſulpherous nature, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154370:34"/>is black, looſe, and moiſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from its great unctuoſity, of which kind we have great ſtore in <hi>England,</hi> in many waſte places, but in <hi>Ireland</hi> much more abundant, where I ſuppoſe that Vineyards might be planted with great advantage; but however, if the ſtory is true which <hi>Glauber</hi> tells us, <hi>viz.</hi> that Vines might be made to grow in hard Rocks, without Earth or Dung, only by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and reducing the hard Rock to duſt by Vegetable Vineger, and ſupplying it with the ſame at the fall of the Leaf, he ſays 'tis much better than Cow-dung to nouriſh the Root, and if we will but rightly conſider the things as they are, we find that out of ſuch Stones is made Lime, out of which Lime by the acid juice of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitables is produced a Nitre, which is the nouriſher of Seeds, becauſe it hath its original from a ſulpherous fatneſs, which attracts a ſalt from the Air, which is the Chariots of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit, and ſo become ſatisfied by the cold Gas: I have ſeen by experience this thing, for in <hi>Holland</hi> in the Winter time, great quantities
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154370:34"/>of Niter have workt it ſelf out of the Walls, which by Diſtillation would give a ſweet, pleaſant, red, ſulpherous Spirit; but 'tis to be obſerved, that generally this Lime is made from Shels, as Oyſters, Muſcles, Cockles, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> theſe being calcin'd as you make Lime, and the ground manur'd therewith, it makes a richer and more fertile Soyl than hitherto hath been known or practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially for moiſt and cold Lands, which want the ſalt niteral Vertue, which is the feeder thereof, and by this means, the ground might be ſo ordered, as Vines might be well planted upon all the Hilly parts of this Country; nay Orchards might be made fertile, by this and ſoot mixed together, and the root be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened about <hi>February,</hi> and the old Soyl taken away, and this added in its place, and after three days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to the Air, let it be cover'd up as before, and ſo your Tree ſhall bear much more abundantly than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; neither is this ſo difficult or chargeable, for if you bear the Root about the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> and expoſe it ſeven days, 'twill attract
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154370:35"/>from the Air ſufficient nouriſhment, being again covered, and this method obſerve'd and follow'd, they will bear plentifully ſeveral years. Now there is a late Writer (which ſpeaks againſt all kind of Science, knowing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of any, and yet would be eſteem'd the only reformer of Old Errors) objects againſt the opening the Earth about the Root of the Tree, ſaying 'tis an exact way to render them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing, when alas, this man is highly miſtaken in this, as well as in ſome other of his rough notions, for that true Phyloſophy doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the Air is the life of all things, in whoſe wings is conveyed up and down the Vital breath and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual moiſture, that is the nouriſher and upholder of beings, and he that would be better ſatisfied, in this point, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to <hi>Sandivogius, pag.</hi> 97. where he treats of the Element of Air; and Philoſophers ſay that Minerals have their Roots in the Air, but Heads or Tops in the Earth, and this muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſalutiferous and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue it hath to beings, whether Animal, Mineral or Vegetable. I will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154370:35"/>therefore lay this down as an infallible Maxim in Philoſophy, that the Air as it acts and is concreted in ſulpherous Matrix to a nitrous Ens, is the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of all things; for as the Rain diſſolveth the Salt Nitre, that ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Water by its Acrimony, this diſſolves the Seed in the Earth, and this diſſolution is the key of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now by the ſame power things are generated, by the ſame likewiſe are they nouriſhed, for the nitroſaline Virtue is by the internal Arche us or Central Sun ſublimed into the powers of Trees, Shurbs and Plants, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the radical moiſture and eſſential juices thereof. I remember a paſſage to this purpoſe, written by <hi>John Welch Van Shandragh,</hi> that in ſome Plants 'tis good to turn the Roots upward, as the Philoſophers do their work, which the Vinitorians do imitate at <hi>Ramſthat,</hi> who order the Roots of the Vines ſo, as they bring Grapes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they will have them to their fancy. If in <hi>February</hi> the Vine is cut, as Yearly it is done, the cuttings are reſerved and dreſs'd, their length is a Cubit; theſe are put into the Ground
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154370:36"/>preſently (yet the point to go out) where they are kept, ſtill to a certain that they do not loſe their moiſtneſs, but remain freſh; in <hi>May</hi> they are taken out again, on the thickeſt part they are cut even one after another, with a ſharp knife, they muſt not be cut ſlooping but even, of theſe cuts one or two hundred are tied up in bundles, many ſuch bundles are made, theſe bundles are thurſt into the ground in an even place and ſet in ſmooth one by the other, then a round pit is made knee deep, and the bundles of cuts are laid in the pit, yet ſo that the heads are turn'd upwards towards Heaven, and the points in the ground, theſe bundles are ſet cloſe one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orderly, and the parts are alike, none over-tops the other, ſtanding ſomething out of the ground, all ſmooth and flat, they being ſet in, the pit is fill'd with Earth, the heads, where the Roots ſhould be ſet on, looks upward, which muſt with Earth be laid round, that no Water may run into the pit when it Raineth, theſe being all ſet into the pit, and ſo ordered as is ſaid, the whole place is covered, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154370:36"/>outſtanding naked heads with Moſs beſpread over, and over that again lay 3 fingers high of Earth, and let them remain there 5, 6, or 8 Weeks, as is needful: Obſerve that
'tis moſt commodious for theſe pits to be made near to a Channel, where the Water may run away, and not ſink into the pit; having thus ſtood, they'l con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract over their tops fleſh pleaſant to behold, which ſometimes is in 5 or 7 Weeks, according as the Weather is good or bad; you may at the end of 5 Weeks make a little hole from above, and ſee whether by the ſaid ſign 'tis time to take them out, for the cuts growing to the Moſs is the ſign, theſe muſt be preſently ſet into the ground again, which muſt be very good, turn them again in their new ſetting, that is the part where the cut is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown, and the place where the Roots ſhould be driven new muſt be turn'd downward, this order muſt be kept with the ſecond ſetting, dividing the bundles aſunder, and ſetting 3 and 3 together, and place them a foot aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with the three in the middle a little open, looking downward or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154370:37"/>backward, for they muſt not ſtand ſtreight one by another, but in the form of a Gooſe-path or ſtep, called, <hi>erdo quincunciislis;</hi> on the point of the out-ſtanding yard muſt ſtand three and three, that they may yield a point, and thus do with all your cuts, which may be put in one plat in lines by one amongſt another; theſe twiggs on the other end thus over-grown, muſt be ſet not upright but ſlooping, which gives the quadrant of a Circle, that is the middle betwixt an upright and lying line, and the leg or guard about a foot long upward cover'd with Earth ſlooping, ſo that the nether part where 'twas over-grown be but half a foot long in the ground, from the <hi>ſuper jicies;</hi> and if that part hath ſore Eyes or Joynts, 'tis to be thruſt in till the upmoſt Eye which ſtand out, that muſt give the growth; if you have thus proceeded you have done well, ye are to obſerve that things thruſt too deep in the ground, be it Trees or others, will not proſper, it cannot help it ſelf, 'tis better to ſet them ſhallow. Now theſe are to be let alone 2 years, but Roots at the firſt year, and at the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154370:37"/>time when other Vines are digged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout or open'd, which is the Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the inlaid Roots muſt be open'd, not only to make the ground more porous, and the Weeds to be rooted out, but the roots muſt alſo be rid of the by-ſhots, and plucked off which grow not downward on the Roots, theſe off pluckt Roots are not taken out, but let them ſet, becauſe the roots be not ſtirred.</p>
               <p>But if thou wilt repair an old Vine, theſe are taken out, and are now call'd <hi>Wortlings,</hi> becauſe they have gotten about the over-grown heads; the beſt root on the nether part is fine to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, looking like a <hi>Swiherbeard;</hi> then you may cleanſe them from ſuperfluous roots, and may ſet them in for a Vine if you pleaſe, in the manner as it is ſet down in the foregoing rules; and ſuch prepared Roots and over-grown Vines is far better than others: for theſe out <hi>Wortlings,</hi> after they have their root well together, are the better able to defend againſt the Froſt, when others hang'd about an Ell high with roots, are kill'd by the Froſt, and ſo the Vines are the more weakned, and are like old
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154370:38"/>Vines, in reſpect of ours. Beſides, ſuch a ſtock in the driving is ſtronger, than thoſe which are put in the ground preſently after they are cut from the Vine, where they muſt take root, not taken out till they be ſet in the rebſtuck.</p>
               <p>If a new Vineyard be made of a ground, which formerly was full of buſhes and a hedge for Hares brood, the firſt new ſet of ſuch twiggs drive ſo ſtrongly, that the double number of ſuch twiggs muſt be laid in, as 8 or 10 twiggs into one place, all which may proſper, yield and bear Grapes in other Vineyards: for to one ſtock are laid but 3 or 4 twiggs, call'd <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites;</hi> and that muſt be done for ſome Years together in a new break, he that doth not know this, and doth not do ſo, the bloſſom then will fall off yearly, the which I have ſeen come to paſs: for the driving in ſuch a new plat, if the ground be good, is too ſtrong, thruſts out and off the Bloſſoms, that you muſt look for your Grapes in the Spring under the Vines amongſt the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154370:38"/>thereby, and brought to a temperature, for each twigg receiveth ſo much ſtrength, and driving as much as it hath need to the full ſeed, and enough for the ſaving of it; and thus your Vineyards being dreſs'd in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will prove and yield double more in the Vintage than other men's will.</p>
               <p>Thus according to <hi>Van Shandragh,</hi> the which I ſhall paſs from, the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage being come, let them proceed how they will ſo that they have a good Vintage from the well manuring, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and dreſſing their Vines, they may expect good ſtore of Bacchean Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the uſual way of making Wines from the Grapes is as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Countrys that abound with Vineyards, they proceed thus; The Grapes when ripe, are pounded in Troughs; or the more common way is, to put them in large half Buts or Tubs, and tread them with their feet, and afterwards with a large preſs they preſs out the juice, as is done in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Syder here in <hi>England,</hi> this is Barrel'd up and let ſtand to ferment, and to clear and reſine it ſelf; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154370:39"/>then they draw it off into ſmaller Casks from its dregs, and this is perform'd naturally and artificially by fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, untill the Wine comes to a good body, and is fine. Obſerve, they ſtop not the Bung hole in its fermentation, but let it ſtand with a pibble-ſtone on the Bung-hole, by which means it is kept freſh and brisk the longer, and is not ſo liable to become ſower. Thus in <hi>Rotterdam</hi> I have drank Rheniſh Wine of conſiderable age.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, that Wines are preſerved from Corruption powerfully and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually (as experience ſhews) by the ſumes of burning ſulpher <hi>vive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are general rules for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all ſort of Wines from the Grapes, but every Country may have ſome variation in their way, and inſtruments uſed; but however, from what hath been ſaid, thou canſt not be ignorant how to make a gueſs and of the other; for by a Penny we know how a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is Coined.</p>

               <p>The Vine is above any other Vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in vertue, being medicinal from the Roots to the Branches, as thou may'ſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Treateth concerning the Spagirical way of diſſecting Concrets, and the office of Eſſences exalting Wines.</head>
               <p>FIrſt we ſhall conſider the various ſorts of dissections there be, to be performed through Chymical and Spagirical operations, between which I put a conſiderable difference.</p>
               <p>For by Chymical ye are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch diſſections as are made by the violence of the Callenary Fire, which rends aſunder thoſe tender parts and interwoven attomes, which nature had ſo friendly united by her internal motion and hidden power of digeſtion, fermentation and concretion, and where this is perform'd in a pure Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, generally there proceeds a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and pure birth; but theſe being thus ſeparated, and eſpecially in thoſe things which are tender and volatile,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154370:41"/>the precious Life and Virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is put to flight inviſibly, as the Spirit is at Man's deceaſe, and nothing but the bare Principles remain; but that you may the better underſtand what I mean by this inviſible Life of concreted Beings, by which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are held in Unity, ſo as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Texture of that Being, I ſhall give you an Inſtance, which to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, proceed thus;</p>
               <p>℞ Twenty Gallons of a fragrant Wine, put it into a Refrigitory with its Helme, lute all cloſe, and diſtill off the Spirit, as long as any will come good, then let all cool, draw forth the Fleame, in which there is a Salt of Wine, and add the Spirit drawn off, to it again, and the Pondus will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little diminiſhed, but the alteration will be very conſiderable; for as it was before pleaſant and fragrant Wine, the tye being broken, it becomes ſtinking and obnoxious, and unſavory to be drunk; for why, the Life is fled away inviſibly, as is plain, becauſe all Savour proceeds from thence; and I do affirm, that he that can reduce this to its firſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154370:41"/>ſtate of fragrancy, deſerves the name of a Philoſopher, and to wear the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land amongſt Spagiricks, not that I think it impoſſible to be done, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and cannot be performed by any other way and means, but that, which adds a new Life by fermentation, and and yet not deſtroy the Original, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Form of the ſpecificated Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur therein contained, call'd the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidum innatum,</hi> of which, no Being can be deſtitute; and yet this reuniting Medium muſt have power to blot out the evil Character, and hidden wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful quality of Death, which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Fire ſtirr'd up, and appeaſe again ſo, as to make an harmonious Unity. Of this Nature, is the Eſſence of Wine, and <hi>Sal panariſtos,</hi> but theſe are Spagirical Operations, and ſhall be touch'd at in their proper place; we ſhall now return to ſpeak of the Office of Chymiſtry, and that part of it, which may ſeem pertinent and advantagious to us in this Diſcourſe, which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally that of Diſtillation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and condenſeth the looſe Atoms, eſpecially thoſe of Spirits, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fermentation, and thoſe let them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154370:42"/>either be Vinor or Urinous, or very Volatile; now Eſſential Oils, are alſo made by Diſtillation, requiring a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of Fire, being the Sulphurs, in another and more ponderous Form; it is alſo profitable for making acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and alſo to make <hi>Sal alkali;</hi> for why, the Fire of Calcination burns up all evil and combuſtible Sulphurs, and fixes down the more ponderous Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and incorporates it with the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parts of the Body, and ſo aſſumes a new Form, containing its Sulphur in <hi>occulto,</hi> for all Salts are ſalimo-ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and all Sulphurs ſulphureous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, as will be manifeſted by union and retrogradation of Form and volatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, but this being a ſpagirick Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it ſhall be ſpoken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of in its proper place; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the uſefulneſs of Chymiſtry, as to this part, only to conſiſt in Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Calcination, for the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Union and Exaltation are Spagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, which we ſhall now come to Treat of.</p>
               <p>Spagirical Operation is not only a ſeparating of the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, but alſo a re-uniting the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154370:42"/>and bringing of them to a Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick and friendly Nature, for we ſee by experience, the more any pure Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are exalted, the more do they contain of the vital fatneſs, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is their Virtue and operative Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on others, but moſt principally on Vinor Spirits, which are always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by a ſulphureous fatneſs; for as <hi>Glauber</hi> ſays, That Vines draw Odors and Savors from the Earth beyond all other Plants, and that Savours may be communicated to the Vine by the skilful at pleaſure, both in their growth, and after they are maturated; for if the Herb Scarlet be caſt into Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wine, it becomes very little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Muſcadine; and again, he ſays, that thoſe rich Wines on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> before-named, are (as he calls it) upon a Mineral Soil, and therefore ſuck up the univerſal and balſamick fatneſs from thence, as may be ſeen in <hi>Pag.</hi> 126. <hi>Par.</hi> 2d. where he ſays, That if the Scarlea, or any other odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous Herb be apply'd to the root of the Vine, 'twill beſtow its Odour on the Grapes; he farther ſays, That if you pour any Oil upon the Root
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154370:43"/>of a ſweet and odoriferous Nature, the Vine will produce Muſcadine for Ten years; and 'tis obſervable that he lays ſtreſs upon the Oil of Seacoal, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleans'd, and rectified with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt; his reaſons (as I conceive) be, becauſe abundance of Seacoals grow, and are digged from thence; and if this is really ſo, why may not there be an encouragement for Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards here in <hi>England,</hi> and other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant growths, ſeeing there is ſuch rich Soil, and ſo well ſtor'd with Minerals and Sea-coal, and we are well aſſured, that the Mineral, or moiſt Vapour, which is a principal Life to concreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beings, in that by its Spirituality it unites with the univerſal Powers and Forms it ſelf into a nitrous or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous balſamick Oil, nouriſheth the Vegetables as it flows forth, and is ſublimed by the Archeius to their Roots, which afterward is elevated into the Branches, and Fruit thereof, and are changed by the forming Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, all one as the different Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we take in, are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſubſtance of our Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> into Juices, Blood, Fleſh, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154370:43"/>other parts as uphold the Fabrick of the body; juſt ſo is it in the Mineral and Vegitable Kingdom; for 'tis as is ſaid the fat and ſulpherous vapour, that nouriſheth them, and is by degrees converted into their own nature, and if any of theſe want this nouriſhing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, they ſoon decay, pine and wither. O how wonderful is nature in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and how many ways hath ſhe unſearchable and paſt finding out; for as the Phyloſophers ſay, Life is ſhort, and Art is long; but let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I ſay then, that the Earth doth abound with this ſulpherous fatneſs, and ſometimes is ſo over-gorg'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that it ſpews it forth through the pores thereof, as is evident by <hi>Petrelaeum,</hi> an Oyl that flows naturally from the rocks, and this we know, that Art both may and often doth ſupply Nature's defects; for if thou take pure Salt of Tartar, and pour diſtill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar thereon, until 'tis aſſatiated, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time drawing off the Fleam, and then diſtill it in a coated Retort by fire of degrees, and laſtly rectify the Oyl thorough the Spirit of Vitriol, 'twil become lucid, pleaſant, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154370:44"/>grant of ſo great virtue, that I call it my <hi>Olcum regeneratum.</hi> With this Oyl much may be done, for frutifying, and nouriſhing the Vinor natures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther externally or internally; I have alſo much to write, concerning the ſulpherous Oyl of the <hi>Magneſia,</hi> which will revive, and cauſe to vegetate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the moſt declining Tree, Shrub, or Plant; How wonderfull is the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and virtue of ſuch ſulpherous fatneſs in the nouriſhing of growths, let it be judg'd of by the Judicious, and let a determination be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, only by the experienced Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or true knowers of Natural things, which are greatly diſcovered to us by our Spagirical Operation, as they are made in Imitation of Nature; and furthermore, Wines may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully exalted by Eſſential Salts, thus, Firſt Chymically ſeperate the Oyl of any Concret, and the remainder Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to aſhes, the pure Salt extract and chriſtalize from thence, and reunite Spagirically the fixed Salt and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Oyl, and bring them to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Salt, or with the Spirit of the Concret diſtill and cohobate ſo long
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154370:44"/>untill it is all brought over in a Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Spirit, this Spirit being imbodied by the Eſſential Salt, plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth its <hi>Callidum innatum,</hi> or drying enriching ſulpher, which gives life and ſulpherous fatneſs, and durable, laſting and ſubſtantial virtues unto Wine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting both the taſte and ſmell thereof. Thus the Salt or Eſſence of <hi>Wormwood</hi> will make rich <hi>Wormwood</hi> Wine; the like will that of <hi>Mint, Balm,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellicoe, &amp;c.</hi> It alſo gives fermentation thereunto, and makes it pure Wine indeed, as Wine refin'd from its Lees, and gives it ſuch qualities, as deſerves the higheſt of commendations, as I could prove by undeniable reaſons in philoſophy, which we muſt omit here, leſt this Volume ſhould ſwell beyond its prefixed Volume, and paſs on to the meliorating and enriching Wines, which is yet more highly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Element of Fire of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is made by ſeperating the Sulphur from the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and mortifying the Sulphur, and diſtilling of it into a Spirit, and <hi>Glauber</hi> doth wonderfully commend the Element of Fire made from common yellow Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154370:45"/>and ſays, that if it be put to defective Wine, it is a preſent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; for if any one put a little of it in a Cask of Wine, the Wine acquires a grateful taſt and odour, and will be ſo comforted, as not eaſily to admit of changing or periſhing as otherwiſe is wont to happen to common Rheniſh Wine; ſee more in his Works <hi>pag.</hi> 3. <hi>par</hi> 3. and I ſay that Wines are alſo enriched by eſſential and fragrant Oyls, ſo prepared as to unite with Water or Spirit of Wine or other Wines; for being dilated by a proper ferment, they are eaſily united, and ſo the Wines are enriched thereby; thou may'ſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I ſaid in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the fumes of Sulphur <hi>Vive</hi> wonderfully preſerves and enrich Wines, and therefore ſuch excellent Medicines as theſe cannot fail of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming much more high; and that I may fully accompliſh the deſire of the Ingenious, I think it convenient to ſpeak concerning the Red Wine of the Philoſophers, which produceth and maketh my <hi>Sal Panariſtos</hi> to appear; for that is prepared from the three firſt principles, chriſtalliz'd in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154370:45"/>three laſt, contained in the fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, as <hi>Sandivogius</hi> ſays, it burns up three and leaves one, which is the Diamond like powder, the true fixed Salt Nitre of the wiſe; and as much may be perform'd by it, as <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> hath attributed to his <hi>Sal mirabilis.</hi> But what ſhall I ſay, I fear the time is not yet come to reveal ſuch Secrets in; for from hence proceeds the very Key to the chiefeſt of <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to Tinctures, Eſſences or Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irs, univerſal or particular Medicines, according to the ſpecificated degrees of the exalted Sulphurs; for as <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Valentine</hi> ſaith, that the Spirit of Wine, or the true <hi>Aquavitae</hi> of the wiſe, hath been ſought for by many, but found by very few: It is the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable ſtone indeed, and man loved Gold and Wine above all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which may be beheld with Eyes. Gold loveth man and Wine, becauſe it lets go its noble parts therein; for if true Spirit of Wine be put to it, being made potable, it gives ſtrength to man, and prolongs his Life and Health: For thus much I am bold to aſſert, that an <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154370:46"/>Univerſal Medicine; and without a true Spirit of Wine, an <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> cannot be made; for Wine bears af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to man, as alſo to Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it eaſily unites with the Tinctures of <hi>Sol;</hi> then it expells Melancholly and Sadneſs, rejoycing Man's heart: For there is originally three ſtones ſo call'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Urinous or Microcoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical one, therefore called Animal, which may be beheld in the beautiful Azoth or Lunar Oyl; the Vegetable, diſcern'd in the Vinor Spirit, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in the golden Tincture or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Laton. The three Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſtones of the Wiſemen <hi>viz.</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal, Tranſmutative, and Angelical; the Triune ſtones or Univerſal, moſt Univerſal the Caballiſtical, Elixerating Tincture for Men and Mettals, ſo much talk'd of, but ſo little known; for why? they do not underſtand the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter, from whence theſe three ſtones are obtained, for it proceeds from one confuſed Chaos, containing a ſpermatical Eſſence of all created beings, the Book of Wonders, and Looking-Glaſs of Nature, wherein ſo many Myſteries may be diſcerned face
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154370:46"/>to face, that I dare not diſcover them here, becauſe time and place is too ſhort; I ſhall therefore conclude with the words of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, He that catcheth this fiery Spirit, hath got victory in this Chymical Battle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe from hence proceedeth the foundation of all Spagirical Medicines, and conſequently the true exaltation of Wine, which we have here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly treated of, and ſo ſhall paſs on to the making Wines from the Growths of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>FIrſt I ſhall define Wine to be a ſpiritualized Sulphur, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with a Mercurial Juice, and ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154370:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>exalted by Natures Concoction, to its degrees of purity, according as the internal Spirituallity hath power to act; but the maturity and perfect ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes and is perfected by the aid and help of the Heavenly Sun, which exhales and detracts the acid and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture, which cauſes the fruit to be unſavoury and harſh; for we ſee by experience, that in cold years, the Wines are much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, than in hotter ones; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall ſhew you, that Wines truly maturated admits of no Argel; but of this in its proper place. Our intended purpoſe is here to let you underſtand, that the Sulphur of a Concret manifeſted, is that which gives the different taſte to Wines, ſo that Wines may not only be made from the Vegetables before nominated, but alſo from other Herbs, Roots, Barks, Flowers, Grains, Honey, and Sugar, by fermentation, and again theſe by diſtillation yield a true Vinor Spirit, which when rectify'd from the Vitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline Alkalizates, looſes much of the external Sulphur, and ſo only the <hi>Vita media,</hi> and ſuch like qualities remain
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154370:47"/>of the Concret; ſo one Spirit may be made ſo near, that it cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, from that which is made from another different Texture; as ſhall be more largely demonſtrated in the 6th Chapter, where we treat of the way of making artificial Brandy-wines. I ſhall come to conſider and ſpeak of an ill Cuſtom made uſe of in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſince the Medicinal Wines have come ſo greatly in uſe amongſt all ſorts of people, the Vintners have been ſo unjuſt, as only to infuſe theſe Herbs, in ſmall Wines, or that which was worſe, in prick'd, low or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd Wines, which have loſt much of their vital ſtrength, and that which is yet material, is, they let the Herb infuſe ſo long therein, that it doth not only attract their Medicinal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but alſo the auſtere and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one; for 'tis very obſervable, that if theſe Wines remain long, they loſe their brisk and pleaſant Nature, and ſo become nautious in the drinking thereof, and ſo by ſuch unworthy practices, the people are many times deceiv'd in their expectation; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they drink theſe Wines, yet

               <p>Firſt, the way to make Wines of all kind of Fruits, is generally one, which is, when the Fruits are ripe, they are ſtampt, and the Juices preſt forth, and then Barrell'd up, and firmented with a Syrrup made with Sugar or Honey, and a little fixed Nitre diſſolv'p there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſometimes we uſe Izinglaſs, Flower, and Whites of Eggs to reſine them down, and being Refin'd, withdraw them out into freſh Casks, or elſe bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them up, which may be preſerv'd wonderfully by my <hi>Sal Panariſtos;</hi> but by the way, I cannot chuſe but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154370:48"/>of a new pretended Reformer (though peradventure he might cull his foundation out of my firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) who ſaith, that Water muſt be only poured on them, and drawn off without a Preſs, and then with Herbs or Seeds, Sugar, Treacle or Honey, being reliſh'd or ſweetned, and firment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Yeſt, this he commends above all others; when alas, he is greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the mark; for firſt, Wines thus made, have not the full Body nor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Fruits; Secondly, being made with Water, they will ſoon rope and ſower. Thirdly, Treacle hath no affinity to Wines, 'tis only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for the dulcifying of Waters, wherefore I rather ſuppoſe he knew not how to diſtinguiſh the difference of my Receipts; Laſtly and chiefly, the one general receipt he pretends to, will not anſwer the different ſort of Fruits; for according as their Natures are, either ſweet or ſower, ſo muſt they be diverſly handled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as will be ſeen by the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts; for Plums, Quinces, Damſins, Goosberries, and ſuch like, ought to be made thus; Example on, <hi>Vinum

Thou art to obſerve in the choice of the Goosberries, they are neither fully ripe, nor too green; for the full ripe will make it thick, and the green will make it ſower; but let them be taken juſt as they are turning;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154370:49"/>be careful that you ſtop not the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too hard at firſt, nor fill them too full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter we are to draw ſome general obſervations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wines, in which we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether or no, new Wine, new Beer are leſſen'd in their virtue by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction as the pretended reformer ſays? No; but on the contrary, they are made much more wholſom and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereby; for in the Elixeration of Malt, the Chief virtue that is extracted by the Water from them is Gummy and Sulphurons, as may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, if upon the ſtrong infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Malt you pour a ſtrong <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi> of <hi>Sal Tartaris,</hi> there ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately precipitate a Gummous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

That Wine may not only be brought to Muſt, and by gentle evaporation ſo condens'd to the thickneſs of Honey, that it may be the better tranſported, but alſo 'tis for the bettering weak and acid Wines, and making them the more noble thereby; nay, he ſays they'r to be made abundantly ſtronger, than when they came firſt from the Grape, only by adding thereto water, or ſmall Wines, and fermenting again, with the Quinteſſence thereof, as thou may'ſt read in him at large: Hence it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154370:55"/>may be clearly diſcerned, how eaſy it is for unexperienced men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their Judgments. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall paſs them by, and proceed further to the improvement of Wines. It is well known to every Vintner, that by the natural action of the Hoggs-head, abundance of fat, rich Lees, or Mother, will fall down, which I have heard a man in <hi>Holland</hi> affirm that he could with eaſe make thereby an Hogs-head of Wine again equal to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; but this is alſo difficult to any but a Spagirick Philoſopher, who knows the virtue of the Quinteſſence of Wine; but however 'tis common to draw off ſmall Wines and put them on ſuch rich Lees, and then refine them down again, by which the Wines are wonderfully better'd: We alſo ſee that Wine is fed with proper food, which is ſweet Fleſh, Salt of Tartar, or more principally the ſweet and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirit of Tartar, and yet higher with the Quinteſſence of Wine, as was ſaid in the 2d Chapter, by Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Salts and prepared Oyls, alſo by Herbs and things of an Aromatical nature; we are alſo ſatisfy'd, that of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154370:56"/>two pipes of ſmall and weak Wines one may be made: for as <hi>Glauber</hi> ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 158. <hi>Part</hi> 1. Nothing can be found, which may render ſmall Wines better than the Animal or Quinteſſence extracted from other Wines; for the Animal of Wine only, and nothing elſe, can encreaſe the ſtrength of Wine. Neither is the compariſon of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration of Wines incongruous with two torn Garments, neither of which can be worn; but if either of theſe is cut, and that which is whole and good is ſewed to the other, and ſo of two one whole Garment is made; then that Garment may be worn, when yet, before, neither of them was uſeful; which points out the very manner by which it is perform'd, to draw forth the Spirit and Quinteſſence of one, and let part of the whole be fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dilated into another: theſe and many other ways there be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich Wines, which we ſhall here paſs by, and proceed to our intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> artificial Wines, and firſt of <hi>Hydromeli,</hi> or Mead. ℞ 20 Gallons of the beſt Spring-water that can be gotten, and put it over the fire, and

               <p>DIſtillation is a ſeparating and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of the moſt Spirituous Liquor from the groſſer part of the body by heat, and therefore the purer your Baſis is, the more pure will your Spirits be, for this end and purpoſe we are now to conſider how we can proceed, that our Hypotheſis may have affinity with the Law; for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath conſtituted a path way for all Diſtillers to walk in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we'l make no breach in this point, I ſhall make uſe of the chief heads therein contained <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Act entituled, <hi>The Encouraging the Diſtillation of</hi> Brandy, <hi>and Spirits from Corn.

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:154370:62"/>
               <p>And 'tis further Enacted by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aforeſaid, that all Diſtillers and others, who ſhall draw or make any low Wines, Spirits or Brandy <hi>from Corn, ſhall brew or cauſe their Corn to be brewed, and made into clean and wholſome drink, and from ſuch drink ſo made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared without any mixture with any</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus, <hi>Waſh, or Tilts, or other materials whatſoever, ſhall draw their low Wines, or Spirits of the firſt Extraction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that the Baſis that Diſtillers are to erect upon, are well brewed Beer, Syder and Perry; therefore the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Diſtillation cannot be ſo hard, ſeeing the making of theſe is ſo well known in <hi>England:</hi> but however, there is one thing yet difficult, which is to give a taſte to Engliſh Spirits, and make it in the ſecond Diſtillation, like to that of Brandy, and that by the addition only of the Products of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſo that this would be very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to cauſe the Wares to be tranſported to moſt of the <hi>European</hi> parts, and this would be wonderfully advantageous both to the Factrage and Products of <hi>England,</hi> as I ſhall more largely touch at in the next Chapter.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154370:63"/>And although I may juſtly claim right to this S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that which is yet more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, by ſuch a publick Manufacturage, the King's Cuſtoms would be highly advanced, and more certain, than in any private hands, whatſoever; for that their Commiſſioners and Collectors might have open recourſe thereunto, with abundance leſs trouble than now poſſibly can be: But of this in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; let us now return from this Digreſſion to Diſtillation.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154370:64"/>things are made uſe of in Diſtillation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we ſhall here treat of, but Firſt of Malt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is nothing elſe but well Brew'd Beer, that is ſtrongly Hop'd, and well firmented, but if it ſhould not be fully rich of the Malt, they Diſtill it as ſoon as 'tis well wrought, for fear it ſhould flat, and then great part of the Spirit is loſt; but if it be very ſtrong, you may keep it to what age you pleaſe. The way to Diſtill it, is thus; Take a large Still, with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine Worm, fixed in a great Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead, with cold Water, to condenſe the Spirits; or in want of that, an Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck; but at firſt be not too haſty with the Fire, but by degrees, make all hot until the Spirit come; if the Still is large, the way I beſt approve for the receiving theſe Spirits, is, to let it run through a Funnel into an Hogſhead, that is placed on the Ground for that purpoſe, and you are to Diſtill as long as any goodneſs will come, which may be known thus, The Taſte will be like an unſavoury Water, when all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is off; this Spirit is call'd Low Wine, which let ſtand 6 or 7 days,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154370:64"/>and then Diſtill it a Second time, which is called Rectification, in which it may be brought into Proof-Spirit, or artificial Brandy, which you pleaſe: Now in this you may know when the Spirit's off the Second time, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of it into the Fire, if it burns
'tis good, but if it puts forth the Fire the Operation is at an end. Theſe Low Wines and Spirits are proper for making moſt ſorts of Waters, as will be ſeen in the application thereof. Now if you rectify a Third time in Balneo, 'twill be the better freed from its Fleam, and a true <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> is made.</p>
               <p>The Dutch way is thus, When the Malt is well made, and new Ground, not above three Hours before
'tis us'd, take thereof Six Buſhels, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large Hogſhead made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſtand upon its end, with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to keep in the Steam, with an hole in the middle, to put in a ſtick to ſtir it upon occaſion, moiſten the Malt with ſome cold Water, and then the other water being made Scalding hot, but take care it boils not, put it to your Malt, and ſtir them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154370:65"/>and when almoſt cold, add halfe a pound of Hops, and let it ſtand till 'tis cold and fit for Barme; and let it work and ferment four or five days, till it comes to the height of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; then put all the Liquor and Grains into ſuch a Still is before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; Make a gentle Fire, and put not the head into the Worm at firſt, for fear it ſhould boil over, and ſo foul the Worm; but if he vapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of low and dead Wines, and their Dregs. Obſerve, that in the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the dreggs of Wine, you may ferment them with their low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd ones, or with the after running of Low Wines, warmed and put into a cover'd Hogſhead, and ferment with Stum a pint to every Galſon; or for want of that Barme, they being truly fermented, draw off the Liquor, and let the Dreggs be put in a Canvas Bag, to preſs out all the moiſture, which ſome perform before they are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; but however, being ready, they may be Diſtill'd as long as ſtrength will come which after 6 or 7 days may be rectified to proof Spirit.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that Stum, which is the Flowers of Wine fermented, kept in ſtrong Veſſels, with Iron Hoops, will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154370:67"/>make an excellent fermentation. It is to be obſerved, that from low Wines, ſmall Wines, and Lees, Brandys are made in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> through Fermentation.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit one thing, which is too too much practiſed by the common Diſtillers, in order to make their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſeem ſtrong, hot and fiery in the Mouth, which to accompliſh, they add in the Diſtillation a pound or two of Spaniſh Grains, which are ſold at the Druggiſts, and theſe perform their deſire; but this is little advantageous to the Spirit, otherwiſe than to make it fiery in the Mouth. Now theſe are the ſubject matters, from which low Wines have been drawn hitherto; but now the Conſtitution of Diſtillation is alter'd, and reduced to three material Pillars, <hi>viz.</hi> Well-brew'd Beer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition, Syder and Perry, to which and in which, may be included all thoſe Wines made and prepared from any of the growths of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe theſe have a greater adherence to and more proper for Medicinal uſe; and therefore preſented to Phyſitians, Apothecaries, and others; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Now I ſay out of ſuch growths the Cuſtoms may be well paid, according to the Tenors of the ſaid Act; and the French Manufacturage may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably detrimented, if that Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were but rightly encouraged; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now all are free, or as many as pleaſe to labour therein, as may be ſeen by the concluſion of the ſaid Act.</p>

                  <p>The way to perform it, is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thus; The low Wine being made, you are to bereave it of its groſs Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which is very eaſily done, then its ſtrong ſmell and taſte will be loſt; as to the Specificated and Domineering qualities thereof, this may be perform'd even on <hi>Rum,</hi> which is the ſtrongeſt in ſmell and taſte of any other Vinor Spirit, drawn from any of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Concrets, and then a middle nature muſt be introduced, naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zating it to that of Brandy; we ſay then, that <hi>Caparaticks</hi> and <hi>Signature</hi> thereof belongs to <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo do Vitriolicks; but the Chriſtals of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Alkalizates</hi> belong to the Sun, to which <hi>Venus</hi> is near a kin; for <hi>Venus</hi> is found to better the Tincture of <hi>Sol,</hi> to which the Vine belongs; now Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and Malt belongs to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which muſt be warm'd by the friendly rays of <hi>Venus</hi> to be impregnated with the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154370:70"/>Idea's of <hi>Sol;</hi> and what ſhall we ſay of Wheat, ſeeing it is the ſtaff of Man's Life, whoſe Oyl hath a principal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature with the Vine, having its ſweet and friendly quallities from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> its generating power from <hi>Venus,</hi> and its ſtrength from <hi>Sol,</hi> and by its Lunar Milk the Chyle is ſtrengthned, from whence the Mercurial life proceeds: But oh! oh! where are you got, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, <hi>the Man and the Mare is fled up in the Air, and there to ſeek their Neſts.</hi> But however, if ſo, the Sun is there rarifying the ſame, and giving forth of its ſolar Virtue to the lunar Matrix, which is conveyed through the Air unto beings; we ſay then, that he, who knows the Airy Life of beings, and how to concatinate the pure Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums thereof, ſo as to make it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, may boldly depend that he knows the nature of that by which a tranſmutation of form is made; of this nature is <hi>Glaubers Sal Mirabilis; Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>'s <hi>Sal Enixum,</hi> and my <hi>Sal Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtos:</hi> We ſee 'tis an eaſy matter to take the Garments off a poor man, and give him more rich ones; ſo
'tis the ſame in this caſe, if we have a true

And if the Philoſophers in the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom, can tranſmute <hi>Jupiter</hi> into vendible <hi>Sol;</hi> why then may not the true Spagiricks in the Vegetable Kingdom change the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> into that of <hi>Venus</hi> and the Sun, ſeeing Tranſmutation is ſo generally allow'd, and we ſuppoſe at this time of day no rational man makes doubt of its verity: Thus much for the way of making Artificial Brandy-Wines. We ſhall now offer ſome Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Encouragement of a Brandy Manufacturage to be eſtabliſhed here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt Conſideration that offers it ſelf is, that by ſuch a Facturage great conſumptions of Corn would be made, and ſo the Tillage in this Kingdom would be conſiderably advanced, the Malt-Corn and ſuch other grain uſed would be advanced in its Price, ſo that the Farmer might well live on it, and yet make Juſt payments to his Landlord, which is by many now found to the contrary; and many Farms (to our Knowledge) are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154370:71"/>places in this Kingdom vacant, which might well be employed.</p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration, this being a publick thing, the publick ſtocks of thoſe concern'd therein would be able to uphold ſuch a Facturage above all by-ends and ſelf Intereſt of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon whatſoever; ſo that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill-houſes and Ware-houſes being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in every County-Town in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or the Dominions thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, the Neighbouring Inhabitants might have eaſy recourſe thereunto to bring in their Wares at Market price, and receive either Wares or ready Money for the ſame; ſo for Wood or other materials requiſite: by this means, trading would be promoted, and Money brought to circulate more freely.</p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration is, by this way and method abundance of Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Recarriage would be ſaved, and yet the Wares lye ready for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation, for which reaſon they might be afforded abundantly more cheaper to all the Foreign Plantations than otherwiſe; and by this means we ſhould conſiderably out-do our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154370:71"/>Countries, and yet very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably advance our own.</p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration is, whereas Spirits are to be Diſtill'd from good and wholſome Beer, we ſay then, the firſt maſhing is only ſit to be diſtilled, and the ſecond maſhing might be brew'd into very good 2d gallon Beer, which would be of great ſervice to the poor Inhabitants, many of which now drink Water for want of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies to brew; we therefore wiſh it was united with and joyned to the Linen Manufacturage. Then as to the Grains, they might be fetch'd off while ſweet, to feed their Oxen, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Hoggs withal; by this means, we ſay, not only many thouſands of poor would be employed, and ſo Trading advanced, and the Land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched; not that, but the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues (as we touched at before) more certain than otherwiſe. We have many more Conſiderations to offer of this nature, but we ſhall omit them till we ſee how theſe are received. And ſo proceed to ſhew the Uſe and Application of theſe Low Wines, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>'s, in making ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154370:72"/>Mint, Balm, Wormwood,</hi> and the like, they ought to be gathered in their prime, and gently dryed; the proportion is more or leſs in quantity, according as you will have the Water in ſtrength of the Herb; for one is ſtronger than another, and an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of <hi>Wormwood</hi> will go further than 2 or 3 of another Herb.</p>
                  <p>To make <hi>Hearts-eaſe, Aqua Vitae,</hi> or rather artificial Brandy. Take as many Gallons as you pleaſe, and to every Gallon add a pound of the Seeds of Hearts eaſe, and the like of the Bloſſoms dryed in the Sun, tye them up in a Bag, and throw them in the Still, and draw off as long as it comes pleaſant, then dulcify with a Syrrup made of Hearts-eaſe and white Sugar put it in the Cask, adding 2 or 3 ſpoonfulls of Barm, and the white of an Egg or two, beaten up with Flour; this will give it Fermentation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it fit to be drawn off for Sale. Obſerve, that in the Diſtillation of theſe Waters, there will be apt to come over an Oyl or white thick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thus to be ſined, as it comes. Take a fine Holland-cloth, and rub one ſide
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154370:73"/>of it very well with Black-Lead, and bind the ſide ſo rubb'd inwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the Worm, and this will keep the thickneſs back, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience demonſtrates; theſe Inſtances may ſerve as general rules, for all ſorts of Waters of the firſt order; but we ſhall only give you another inſtance.</p>
                  <p>Now if you'l make any rich and Cordial Waters, you had beſt make uſe of Brandify'd Spirit, which is the Spirit of Mault, or any others brewed of their taſte, and impregnated with an azural Salt of a Vinor nature, and ſo will the Spirit taſte more fragrant of the concret than otherwiſe: Inſtance, Take of the beſt Cinamon 5 pounds, of artificial Brandy 5 Gallons, Sugar of Honey one pound and half, let them infuſe 20 days, and then diſtill off the Spirit, which dulcify with its own Syrrup; and we ſay then, this is beſt and trueſt Spirit of Cinamon, that can be made, and moſt fit for Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſe, and thus much for Simple Spirits made <hi>per ſe.</hi>

The Third Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a weak Brain, and Catarrh, and for the Palſie and Gout: And what I have to ſay further, is, that theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being opened by a proper Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſweet Spirit of Salt, or true Spirit of Tartar, much might be expected from it, for Wounds, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>Neli me tangere</hi>'s, Plague-ſores, Pearl in the Eyes, Strangury and Stone, Leproſie, weak Members, Agues, Rheumes, Impoſtumes, Fiſtula's, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids; but now obſerve, by means of the Menſtruum, they'l not riſe in thoſe diverſities, but in an united Form, ponderous and balſamick, and yet more, according to the degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation impos'd thereon by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>To reduce Spirits for the making of Cordials Reduction of Spirits, is in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154370:77"/>order to bring them to a middle Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, by uniting the Aquous part with the moſt Spiritual, and ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Union, as may be ſeen by the following Example. Take a quart of Water, and a pound of white Loaf Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, boil them well together half an Hour, or more; then let it cool fit to put Barm to it, but while it is Blood-warm put in Spices, ſuch as you beſt fancy, as <hi>Jamaica</hi>-Pepper, Cinamon, Cloves, or Orice roots ſliced, and and when cold enough, add your Barm, and let it work as Beer; and after it hath well work'd, you may uſe it for bottleing of Ale, Mead, Cyder and Wine; if you add to every Bottle two Spoonfuls thereof, a little Orice-root, and a ſew grains of the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal of Tartar, and a bit of Loaf-Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and being laid cloſe, 'twill make it drink exceeding brisk.</p>

               <p>Theſe Powers abundantly ſurpaſs the Spirit in Virtue, being only originally prepared by me in <hi>Holland,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to both Univerſities, did pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel; nay, in ſome degrees outſtripp'd that of the greateſt Pretenders in the <hi>European</hi> Parts; both for ſtrength and pleaſantneſs of Taſt; The <hi>Modus Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi</hi> thereof, I never fully diſcover'd; but however, for the popular Service
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154370:79"/>I taught ſeveral of my Diſciples in their Chymical courſe, the true and genean Spirit, and this I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That this very Spirit, althô much inferior in preparation to the Powers, hath been ſophiſticated, and when brought to the Publick, we have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern'd, that it hath not been Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd by Fermentation <hi>per ſe,</hi> but they have ſupplyed their defects here, by adding Horſe-reddiſh, which hath not affinity therewith; this hath much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd its value, in coming ſhort of its Original; for too too many there be, that care not how indifferent a thing is, ſo they can but make it at a cheap rate, and in great quantity, eſpecially if they have their Name up—. Now, conſidering this, together with the prevalent Arguments of Ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of what great ſervice the Powers of Scurvy-graſs might be (more than the Spirit) if Publiſh'd, I have in anſwer thereunto, done it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly and the more eſpecially, ſeeing its virtue is ſuch as to continue its uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Powers of Scurvy graſs have an excellent Virtue in many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, but particularly againſt the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154370:79"/>Scurvy; becauſe the Herb hath a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſignature againſt the Diſeaſe; and thus much I will be bold to ſay of thoſe my powers, that they give Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Blood, by diſſolving and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipating congealed humours; for by their Alkalizated Nature they mundify, and by their Vinor nature the Venoms are embib'd, and the humours thin'd, giving ſanity to the principal Faculties; for being duly taken, they deſtroy not only the Saline, but alſo the Acid and Crude humours, from whence the Scurvy hath its original, whether bred by the eating of Groſs, Raw, or Crude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:154370:82"/>then ſhould not the Powers of Elder (ſeeing the Principles are therein radically united) contain all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Virtues, and in great Superiority; Firſt, becauſe the Spirit is made by Fermentation, and exalted to a <hi>Vinor ens,</hi> wholly ſulphureous and inſlama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which to perform, ſome have eſteem'd ſo great a ſecret. Secondly, the Spirit is enriched by its own Oyl. And Thirdly, Strength, and by the Salt, ſo that theſe Powers are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo high, as to contain the medicinal Virtue of the whole; now perceiving of what general ſervice theſe Powers might be, I thought it convenient to publiſh it; and the more eſpecially, diſcerning the things of ſingle Virtue, have taken place in the World, by ſome kind of Service, as namely the Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, and Spirit of Roſemary, or <hi>Hungarian</hi>-water.

            <p>The Quaery therefore will be, how true Medicine (and ſuch as will really relieve the Diſeaſed) may be prepared, in anſwer whereunto we refer you to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, in the Knowledge of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſmical ſtructure, and how Diſeaſes ariſe in human kinds, ſo as to aſſault the Animal Life, and ſenſitive Soul; for we find that all the Diſeaſy Idea's are conveyed in the vehicle of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Juices to the conſtitutive parts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In knowing the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of Diſeaſes, and how changes and variations are made in ſimple and complicate ones; for 'tis very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the concurrences, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eventual accidents thereof, be praeominated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, theſe being underſtood, we may boldly inſiſt upon the Cure of Diſeaſes, by a Judicious Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of proper Medicines, and by ſuch variations, as are requiſit for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed to lay down the Riſe and Nature of Diſeaſes, we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154370:91"/>think it convenient (to make our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the more plain) firſt to define what a Diſeaſe is; a Diſeaſe therefore is defin'd to be an aſſault made upon the Spiritual Life, in human kinds, in order to make a breach of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Harmony.</p>
            <p>For 'tis plain to us, that Diſeaſes have their firſt Exiſtence in the very principles of Life, and ſenſitive Soul, by which they are conveyed to the Archaeus, (who is, as we ſay, the central vital Spirit, exalted to the higheſt ſtate in the Microcoſm) which diſtributes a vital ray, of which <hi>Ares</hi> is Specificator, to all the parts and Members of the body, which being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the Diſeaſy Idea's, whether Superior Influences, Epidemick Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms, or other accidents, cauſing Terror, Fury and Amazement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature becomes unmindful of her own office, and admits of Diſeaſes, and ſometimes death without reſiſtance: Becauſe by ſuch preternatural actions the wrathful quality is ſtirred up, which otherwiſe lay ſilent in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the body: for (as we have ſaid in our <hi>Medicina Rationalis</hi>) the feed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154370:92"/>of Life and Death is placed, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally exiſteth, in the Center of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, and of Man, in order to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due him to fear, and reverence his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; for, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>From Adam death reigned upon all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Archaeus</hi> hath ſuch a pure Central Life, that it is immediately put into fury and diſtraction, by thoſe clouds the diſeaſes Idea makes, which being antipatherical to its purity, it cannot but oppoſe, endeavouring ſo long to caſt them off, till enraged thereby, and ſo neglecting its own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, many times immediately admits of death; but, if not ſo ſoon, theſe untoward gueſts take place, captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and deſtroying, and as they have admittance, aſſume Matter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come corporeal; whence, according to its continuance, proceed chronick diſeaſes, or ſuch as be of difficult cure: For this matter (as we have ſaid in our <hi>Spagirick Philoſophy aſſerted</hi>) is by degrees diſſolved, and ſpread through the Body, and ſo univerſally aſſaults the whole Fabrick, or at leaſt wiſe ſome principal part, or organ thereof, whence ſomtimes proceed Obſtructions, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154370:92"/>Melancholy, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for the Humors, eſpecially the predominant, have thereby power to overflow; thence Diſeaſes from the inequality of Humors, which often are remotely promoted by the ſix Non-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals.</p>
            <p>We therefore aſſert theſe to be the accidental, not the original or Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farctick Cauſe of diſeaſes, as many will have them, and that by theſe. Nature is deprived of her own State and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and led into that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her; which prevails ſo long, as the <hi>Anatomia Eſſata</hi> hath power to Dart forth her venom, in order to extinguiſh the Fountain of Life.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore ſtate this as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aphoriſm in Phyſick, that if the Spirit, the Fabricator and Conſervor of Human Bodies, ſtands clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, being not infected by the clouds of Diſeaſes; the Body, which is the Receptacle of the Spirit, muſt needs remain in a vigorous activity, for no morbifick Matter can exiſt therein, but by the Spirits Error, which afterwards forms Matter, and becomes corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:154370:93"/>
            <p>For as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.28. <hi>How can one enter into a ſtrong Man's Houſe, and ſpoil his Goods, except he firſt bind the ſtrong Man;</hi> In reference hereunto, the Spirit may be ſaid to be a ſtrong Man, and the Arche, as the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Microcoſme, which exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins all, therefore muſt be firſt bound and captivated, before the Houſe or Body can be deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general concerning the Original of Diſeaſes, and their forms impreſs'd by the Diſeaſes Idea on the Spirit, through which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come corporeal; we ſhall now conſider by what Medium they act; We ſay then, as the external Air of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm, is the Medium between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, containing the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Spirit, by whoſe Power Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Generation to Generation, and by the deprivation thereof, Death, Corruption and Deſtruction; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned, corrupted and infected with divers Spiritual Forms, whether Superior or Inferior, by exhalation of corrupted Fumes, for 'tis a Matrix that receives all, till over-burthen'd or infected thereby, it ſends forth its
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154370:93"/>venom both on Man and Beaſt; as is too too evident in Peſtilential times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So 'tis in the Air of the Microcoſm, where the Spirit acts, that being the medium between Life and Death, and conſequently, the effective Inſtrument of Health and Diſeaſes; for that being over-burthened, either by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Influences, or Spirituality of the different exhalations, proceeding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a ſubſequent Cauſe, or the immediate Paſſions and exaſperation of the Mind, by Anger, Grief, Fear, or the like; or of the Body by ſuddain motion, or Cold, by which the Spirit is too much inflamed, or contracted, or from the ſuperabundance of Meat or Drink taken: For althô theſe are the handmaids and nouriſher of Life, yet when taken in exceſs, they many times become the very inſtrument of Death, like as the moſt choice <hi>Panacea,</hi> which by a ray of its light, is able to cure all Diſeaſes, yet too many rays thereof will overpower the natural one, and ſo extinguiſh it: wFor as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divogius</hi> ſays, a great Fire ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes a ſmall one, and that many of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154370:94"/>the Philoſophers have deſtroy'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by not knowing the right uſe of the grand <hi>Panacea;</hi> for we are to receive things in Temperance, ſo as to ſtrengthen the natural heat, and not to overcome it, as we have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in the Preface.</p>
            <p>'Tis no wonder indeed, why there ſhould be ſuch variation in Diſeaſes, and ſo many new and complicate ones ariſe; if we rightly conſider how great the exceſs and intemperance, this age abounds with, is, for from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a debilitation of the Spirit, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Spiritual Juices, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to cacochamick ones, and from thence corruption; and this being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Debaucheries, receiving from each other the Spiritual vapour of their poiſonous <hi>Venom</hi>'s, the Grand Pox is contracted; which, being not timely cured, corrupts and ſtains the Veſſels with its Diſeaſes Malignancy, and is often ſent forth to the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Body, and internally ſtains the radical moiſture, cauſing an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumated Seed, and decayed Body; from whence, in the act of another Generation it ſtamps its Ideas, or its
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154370:94"/>Matrix; from hence hereditary Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the cauſe of ſo many weak and imperfect Children, which alſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, produce the ſame effects, and ſo cauſe ſuch other new complicate Diſeaſes, &amp; ſuch as become the amaze and aſtoniſhment of Phyſitians; for 'tis not only the Diſeaſes varying, and divers ſymptoms thereof appearing, but alſo ſome new ones are commonly &amp; yearly produc'd, vaſtly different from the other: And this is obſerv'd, and for a truth generally agreed upon by moſt of the Learned and Curious obſerving Phyſitians, that I have met with in my <hi>European</hi> Travels.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the crazineſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectneſs of Bodies, in this our Age, are much to be pittied and lamented: for let the Phyſitian come where he will, he can ſeldom fail of diſcrning ſome Symptoms and evil Effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and 'tis much to be fear'd, that the Intemperance of this Age will cauſe ſuch evil Fermentations, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce yet worſe Diſeaſes, which (I pray God) the Inhabitants may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent by timely Repentance, for I dread the ſoreneſs of the Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:154370:95"/>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, 'tis eaſie to be conceiv'd, that Intemperance hath been as a Procatarctick Cauſe of many Diſeaſes; ſtaining the Spirits, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Humors, and many times the principal Veſſels, cauſing ſimilar, organick, and common Diſeaſes: For we ſay, that one original Cauſe may in different Bodies or Conſtitutions, produce different Effects, and the more different ſymptoms, according as it hath its ſituation, or power to aſſault the <hi>Syntereſis</hi> of Nature: We ſhall therefore ſtate another Aphoriſm, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Spirit being the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of diſſeaſy Idea's, thoſe alſo muſt be Spiritual, and carry with them their own Seed, and forming Power; or elſe no ſpecification of a diſeaſe, could be made.</p>
            <p>Now this being ſo, we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what thoſe diverſity of Forms are, that produce diverſity of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes For we ſee, that in Epidemick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, which thô, generally proceed from corrupted venoms, yet each of them cauſe different Characters on the Body: The Meaſles one, the Small Pox another, the Swine Pox another,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154370:95"/>the Spotted Fever another, and the Plague another: For that hath the moſt raging power, or violent burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, painful Blains, Carbuncles, or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's, as a teſt of Rage, changing the ſame, in, and with the ſolid parts to the blackneſs of a Coal, or ſtinking Pus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by all of theſe the Life is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently threatned, according as the Form hath power immediately to work upon, and prevail againſt the light of Nature. This diverſity of diſeaſie Idea's may not ſeem difficult to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if we but conſider, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matter of all things was originally one, and that the diverſity of Species came in the World, by, and from the character and ſtamp of Form in the Animal, Mineral, and Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in all the kinds thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For (as the Apoſtle ſaith) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body hath its own Seed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Seed its own Body. In the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Kingdom, the Body is Salt, the Form Sulphur or Oil, which are diſcernably different in Taſt and Smell, one from another, which whilſt the Texture remained, had power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154370:96"/>its Form in multiplication of its kind, through the power of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit. In the Mineral Kingdom, the Body is Mercury, but that which gives the various Forms, is Sulphur, which through the Medium of the Univerſal, grow, and are multiplied. In the Animal Kingdom, the Body is Fleſh, but the Form is that which makes the diverſity, according as 'tis pure, purer, or moſt pure; the moſt pure is Man, being animated with the Divine Light; the Pure is Fiſh and Foul; and the leſs Pure is Fleſh in its divers and brutiſh kinds; yet all live, increaſe and multiply through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the Univerſal Spirit: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Man (being a Microcoſme, an Epitomy of all Forms, a Compendium of all Powers, and Syſtem of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Inferior Beings) muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be acted upon by all Forms: For, as Legions of Angelical Spirits are for miniſtring Comfort to Man by the Rays of Light; ſo on the other hand, Are there Legions of Diabolical ones, ſtirring up their Inſtruments to dart and poiſon him with the black cloud of Leath: Therefore we ſay, that as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:154370:96"/>the Spirit of Man is acted upon by the divers diſeaſie I dea's; &amp; yet the Primary Matrix of Diſeaſes one, <hi>viz.</hi> a moiſt, mercurial poiſonous Air, which we call the <hi>Anatomia Eſſata,</hi> whoſe exiſtence is in all the urinous Spirits in the Body, and is fed by the ſame, in which the different Idea's Act and Form ſeveral Species by the Medium of the Spirit, in the little World, even as 'tis in the Spirit of the great World.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we ſay, that all kind, or ſpecies of Diſeaſes are produced by the Spiritual Action of the diſmal Form; and according to the nature of the Humor acted upon, or of the Veſſel, Organ or Paſſage, that 'tis incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, and as 'tis nearer or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſituated to the <hi>Archaius:</hi> For we ſee that in the Itch and Scabs, the Blood is corrupted and infected; as alſo in the Scurvy and Scrofulous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; yet each of theſe are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly different one from another, and all different from the former: which ſtill demonſtrate diverſity of Forms in the ſpecification of Diſeaſes: And again, in the French Pox, which having its riſe from complicate Vapors, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154370:97"/>in like manner complicate Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which have ſome or other reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of various ſort of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Now if the Form is of a Saturnal Nature, dull and languid in Motion, from thence Hypocondriack Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and inveterate Obſtructions, hard to be removed. Now the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operation of theſe ſulphurous Idea's, or black Clouds, will be more fully ſhewn in my <hi>Spagirick Philoſophy aſſerted,</hi> where the Original of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is more fully demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being rightly known, and conſider'd, we may be able to make proper Indications of Diſeaſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produced ſimply from one Cauſe, or compounded with different Forms; whence proceed rebellious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate Diſeaſes: <hi>Ex. Gr.</hi> The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Grand Itch in one uniting in <hi>Coitu</hi> with the acid or muriatick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in another, produceth, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth a venemous Vapour, which may prove as a Progenitor to the Pox; and eſpecially when 'tis heighten'd by a volatile Acidity in a ſecond Action. The manner of which, ought truly to be known.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:154370:97"/>
            <p>And again, when the Scurvy after the ſame manner unnites with the grand Pox, it may cauſe ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fermentation in the blood, as to produce a Feaver; ſome of which I have known ſo violent, that death hath immediately enſued.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many more of the like nature, produce ſuch complicate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as have before been touch'd at, ſo that the moſt learned of Phyſitians at the firſt ſight by the Diagnoſticks and Aetiologicks are put to an onſet, how rightly to give their Prognoſticks, which we ſhall endeavour to unfold, according to our experience, in our <hi>Medicina rationalis,</hi> and briefly in our <hi>Spagirick Phyloſophy aſſerted,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitting here</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore conclude, that diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are invenom'd, poyſonous Idea's, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs corporify'd; and ſo emitting their various effects and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and by degrees working upon the radical Moiſture, or vital Spirits, till they are exhauſted, and then by conſequence death enſues.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing 'tis a duty incumbent upon every Phyſitian, to endeavour by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154370:98"/>true Specificks to heal thoſe breaches and inrodes, made upon Nature, whilſt the Oyl remains in its determin'd Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus unexhauſted: To the end, our mite may be contributed, we ſhall thus demonſtrate the <hi>Therapeutick</hi> part as follows.</p>
            <p>Finding therefore, that Diſeaſy Idea's are diſmal Clouds, whereby the Spirit of Life is ſtain'd, in order to produce death, for Diſeaſes are its Meſſengers; we ſhall therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your Conſideration the ſearch of ſuch Arcana's, or ſuitable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſuch (we mean) as will emit ſome rays of light, whereby the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul or Spirit of Life in human bodies may be illuminated, and which being rightly apply'd, have power to remove the Cauſe, and reſtore Nature to ſanity.</p>
            <p>Of which number are all thoſe, that are Spagirically prepared from the Chaos of the Adepts: and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their grand, univerſal, Tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sulphur, againſt which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man dare object, ſeeing there is ſuch an unanimous concurrence in the writings of the learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154370:98"/>Spagiricks: For they maintain the Poſſibility of one Medicine to have virtue ſufficient to cure all Diſeaſes. And 'tis no wonder it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing 'tis an Eſſence of ſuch Purity, as to have Predominancy over the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and corrupting powers, being a Domicile, wherein the firſt form of light is concatinated in the Effl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>viums of Life, and thence having a central Homogeneity, preſerves the fewel of the Lamp from being ſtained with the Diſeaſy Idea's, and Nature from erring in its Harmony; and when it doth err;
'tis a ſure Panacea to reſtore it again to ſanity, maintaining the Microcoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Wheels in due <hi>Decorum</hi> till the appointed time of Death, there being an Irrevocable degree, paſs'd, againſt which there can be no Balme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, 'tis to be obſerved, that all Arcana's proceeds from the Power, Action and Virtue of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os general; as alſo the <hi>Menſtrum Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is the <hi>Medium,</hi> by which Medicines, are prepared, and indeed without which there can be no true Eſſences, Elixirs, Magiſtrys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever high names are given to many extant.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:154370:99"/>
            <p>Moreover 'tis to be obſerved, that by the help of this general Spirit, we open the body of Tartar, uniting the extreams ſo, as to bring it to act in a ſuccedanous way, and Spagirically to operate on moſt inferior bodies, and thereby to obtain their true Specifick virtues, which Medicines are eſteem'd the ſuccedanous ones, and ſhort of theſe there are very few that will raiſe any conſiderable advantage to the Sick, let the commendation impoſed by the makers thereof be ever ſo ſoaring; and 'tis daily confirmed by experience, that there be all-to-few Medicines, that by far anſwer what is attributed to them; becauſe there be no Specificks, but what are prepared through a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Agent, of which number is Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which is of ſuch a Nature, as to coagulate upon the body diſſolved, but 'twill obtain from the Concret its Caracteriſtical Powers, and hidden Specifick Vertues; and on the other hand, the Concret obtains from the Diſſolvent an abſterſive Nature, and by the action and paſſion the points centre into a Globical or Balſamick Ens, which is agreeable to our conſtitutive
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154370:99"/>Principles, and ſo operate in thoſe pure Effluviums, as to perform real Cures, to the comfort and ſatisfaction of the Patient, and Honour of the Honeſt-hearted Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Conſideration muſt not be omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis neceſſary to obſerve variation in their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, according to the alteration of the Diſeaſe; for our Ten Years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews us, that 'tis neceſſarily required in Practice, to make a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious variation in the Diſpenſation of Medicines, if we deſign that they ſhould fully anſwer: For the way and Method, we obſerved 5 years ago, muſt be alter'd in the Preſcriptions of this preſent year: For tho' the Method was certain then, in the Diſeaſe of the ſame kind, or ſpecies, yet ſuch have now other Twiggs, Branches, and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which neceſſarily require to be prun'd off: For theſe, and ſuch like reaſons, the Author would not willingly out ſpeak the vertue of any ſingle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; yet his experience is ſuch, that he will thus much boldly declare for the encouragement of the Diſeaſed,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154370:100"/>that if theſe do not demonſtrate their Virtue on them in 30 or 40 days, ſo as to give a grounded belief of a real Cure, he adviſes ſuch Patients to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from means, except the Phyſitian that follows him, can demonſtrate, that he is in Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Grand Panacoea,</hi> or <hi>Univerſal Medicine;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Cure is highly to be doubted. Thoſe true Sayings have been found by experience, by ſuch, that have not been willing to regard our Advice, but would be tampering and ſpending their Money, and yet alas, the Diſeaſe hath remained, until the Eyes have been cloſed, and they have given their laſt farewel to the World: Of this we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble to give undeniable proofs.</p>
            <p>The laſt Obſervation is that theſe Sovereign Specifick Medicines are more certain in their Operation, where the Patient obſerves with heedfulneſs the methods preſcrib'd, and is temperate in exerciſe, Meat and Drink, and yet we allow all things in Moderation, ſo far, that the moſt curious Pallate may be pleas'd with ſuch variety as Nature affords.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſatisfaction of all that

            <p>The fixed Salt of Tartar is to be volatiliz'd three diſtinct ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by acid Spirits, and then being diſtilled over into a middle Spirit, they aſſume the name of <hi>Arcana Pontiſſitata;</hi> alſo by urinous Oyls, and Spirits, and then they aſſume the name of <hi>Arcana Micro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>coſmica;</hi> alſo by eſſential Oyls and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Spirits, and then they aſſume the name of <hi>Arcana Samick;</hi> not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, becauſe of its friendly Balſamick Nature, homogenious to, and in the preparing of Medicines; therefore I ſhall touch at that, and omit the others, ſeeing we have diſtinctly laid them down in our <hi>Spagyrick Philoſophy's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:154370:117"/>cannot be ſufficient for all ſort of Liquors; for ſome kind of Fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made with Water into Wine, will ſoon ſour and rope, as having not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſufficient for their ſubſiſtence, and will not yield in Diſtillation Spirits ſufficient for the making of <hi>Vinum For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatum,</hi> or that which ſome call <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Wine Royal;</hi> therefore I think it convenient for the full Inſtruction of thoſe that deſign to Encourage or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance theſe Liquors, to give them theſe four following Obſervations, concerning the moſt exact way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if you deſire to have your Cyder, Perry, or Wine durable, the Fruits muſt be gathered in ſuch a time as no moiſture is on them, but that the Sun hath exhal'd the fame; For to be ſure, if they are gather'd in wet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will be Muſty; now your Fruits are not to be gather'd Green, nor rottenly ripe, but in their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fulleſt richneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secodly, Thou art to obſerve, that your Fruit being well gather'd, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from their Stems, they may lye in a Tub three or four Days, by which
<pb facs="tcp:154370:118"/>

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:154370:119"/>means, being broken and preſſed, 'twill ſooner admit of Fermentation: For 'tis obſervable, eſpecially for Apples and Pears, that they are not ſo fit for the Preſs, till they have lain ſo long on heaps, as to ſweat and dry again; for by ſuch a natural Action, their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virtues are the more eaſily mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; For we have obſerved this in making our <hi>Vinum ribeſium,</hi> or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Wine, and for every Gallon of Currans, if we add Three Pints of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or Sugar-water, or letting of them lye about 14 or 18 Hours, the Wine will gain abundantly the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Body; for a ſmall quantity of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar acuates and ſtrengthens the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo as to cauſe it to draw forth the whole Virtues of the Fruits, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be well broken and mixed together, and being preſs'd out, you may let it refine from its firſt Setlings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then rack it off from thoſe groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lees, if you deſire to make a <hi>Vinum Fortificatum</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Theſe Wines being made muſt lye at the leaſt, 8 or 10 Weeks to come up to their full Body and Strength; for 'tis obſervable that no new
<pb facs="tcp:154370:119"/>Wine will give any more than an aqueous Phlegme in Diſtillation, untill they have fully paſſed the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or Working, and begin a little to ſower, for then they afford the greateſt plenty of Spirit, but I mean, not ſo ſower as to make Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, for then the Spirit is oylified and concentricated, and again, admits of its weakeſt part firſt, therefore, I mean ſuch a Sower as manifeſts the Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fermentation only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thoſe Syrups or Sweets, that you add to your Wines, are moſt proper to be made from the cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Water of the ſame, in which the Body of the Fruits are macerated, or elſe from the Juices decocted with Sugar, and well clarified with Whites of Eggs from time to time, until your Syrup becomes exceeding fine and pure, this will (being added to your Liquor) better ſatisfie hungry Nature, which muſt always have ſomething to feed upon, as we ſee by experience in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wines; For there is no <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigue, Burgundy, Frontineack, Greek</hi> or <hi>Florence</hi> Wines, but what are in ſome meaſure or other upheld by Art.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154370:120"/>
            <p>You may remember that I ſaid in the Two Firſt Chapters, that the Fumes of burning Sulphur wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Wines; For although you may obſerve all theſe aforeſaid Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet if you meet with an improper Cask, it may give an ill tang to your Wine: In <hi>Holland,</hi> the Method we have to prevent this, is thus, They make large Brimſtone Matches, and ſome dip them in Coriander Seeds, and burn them in the empty Cask, juſt before they put their Wines in, and thus they do ſo often as they are racked, and ſo you may do with your Ciders, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Wines, this being an excellent Expedient to prevent ill Taſts and Fermentation; as alſo to preſerve the Wine.</p>
            <p>☞ There are many other ways in preſerving of Liquors, amongſt which, my <hi>Spiritus Odontugoſus</hi> is of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy: For tis found a rare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt Corruption, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering dying Beer, Ale, Cider or Wine from their decaying; and a Cure for Beer, when ſick and roping; and 'tis not only a preſerver for theſe, but alſo for Fleſh, keeping it ſo long from
<pb facs="tcp:154370:120"/>corruption, as that there is not any Embalming in the World can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it for the keeping of a Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſe; nor no Salting comes near its efficacy as to Conſerving Meat, Fowls or Fiſh, which by this means are not only kept conſiderably from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but made a Mummial Balſom, which is it ſelf a preſervative to ſuch as ſhall take thereof, being a rarity very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for ſuch as have bad Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, whence Corruptions do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wine that is preſerv'd, hath alſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny excellent Virtues, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; as alſo prevalent in abating the Thirſt in Fevers, and taking off of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Symptoms, which we ſhall deſiſt from here, and come now to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of ſmall Wines, into a <hi>Vinum Fortificatum,</hi> which may be by the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcence</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or my <hi>Sal Panariſtos,</hi> be made Superior to <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Cyder-Royal,</hi> as ſome name it, whereof we ſhall now ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vinum Fortificatum.</hi> ℞ A Barrel or Hogſhead of ſmall Wine, Cyder, or any other, and put it into a Copper Still, and Diſtill ir as long as any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

<pb facs="tcp:154370:121"/>Liquor two Ounces of fixed Nitre, put up in a Linen Rag into the Bung-hole, at the top of the Cask, and let hang down in the Liquor, 'twill ſoon ripen it, or any other new Wines, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſower ones drinkable: For this Art of bettering Wines, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the worthy and ingenious <hi>Glauber;</hi> according to what is laid down in his Works, <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 158. as we before quoted in <hi>p.</hi> the 44th of this Book; for that is the true ground of making <hi>Vinum Fortificatum,</hi> which ſaid Authors Works was Publiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any <hi>Cyder Royal</hi> was thought on; for 'tis a great error not to render to every Author his due Honor for his Invention, and to aſſume to our Selves that which really belongs not to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by thoſe Ways and Methods, any of the Engliſh Liquors, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Cyder, Perry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be advanced to the full ſtrength of Foreign Wines, and more eſpecially thoſe of Currans and Goosberries, which will give a Wine much like ſome of thoſe that come from the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, and may in all things be as profitable to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb facs="tcp:154370:122"/>Bodies, nay, in ſome kind, more advantageous, as having affinity to the Climentary Conſtitutions, as we have ſaid in the Preface.</p>
            <p>Now you are to obſerve, that if any of theſe aforeſaid Liquors, or Wines, ſhould come upon the Frett, which will deſtroy it, you muſt, as they do in <hi>Germany,</hi> draw it off into other Veſſels, and do ſo once in eight Days, until it hath done ſpattering, for by this ſpattering the Lees are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it, wherein the groſs and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sulphure is contained; You muſt obſerve, that whilſt it thus frets, your Cask muſt not be too full, nor cloſe ſtopt, but after it ceaſes, you may ſtop it as cloſe as may be; but if you ſhould fear, that any action ſtill remains, give it Air at the Vent-hole once in 4 or 5 Days for your ſatisfaction; Obſerving that my <hi>Spiritus Odentugiaſus</hi> being imbodied by <hi>Salt-prenelle,</hi> and hang it in the Cask, as before directed, will ſtop the violence of ſuch a Frett, but more eſpecially, my <hi>Sal Panariſtos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, if any of theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Liquors, Wines, or <hi>Vinum Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatum</hi> ſhould become unpleaſant and
<pb facs="tcp:154370:122"/>unfit to be drunk, then take a Cask of it, and a Cask of new Liquors or Wines of the ſame Fruit, before it be quite clear or fine, and mix them together in two other Casks, well ſweetned as before directed, and adding a due quantity of Syrrup and Spirits, and in two or three Months time, 'twill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come excellent and pleaſant Liquors, and the more eſpecially if you add thereunto ſome fixed <hi>Niter,</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically prepared, as the Author does it.</p>
            <p>Thus much at this time for the way of preparing, advancing, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Liquors, wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I ſhall now leave, and proceed to ſpeak of the remaining Virtues of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors noble and unparallel'd <hi>Spiritus Odontugiaſus,</hi> or a ſingular and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit for whitening and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Teeth, curing the Scurvy in the Mouth, and preventing the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſe of the Toothach, taking off the cauſe of Putrifaction, and ſo cures a Stinking Breath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if you ſcowr your Teeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with 2 or 3 times they will become purely white, like Ivory; the Mouth
<pb facs="tcp:154370:123"/>being waſhed therewith, it prevents the growing of the Yellow Scales, which uſually adhere to the Teeth, diverts Rheums, and takes off the cauſe of Putrifaction, and ſo preſerves them from a future Corruption; it kills Worms in the Teeth, faſtening thoſe that are looſe; and if this Spirit was generally us'd, it would ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the pain in the Teeth, that the Tooth-drawer for the Future might expect but little work. 'Tis likewiſe obſerv'd, that it brings good Fleſh upon the Gums. 'Tis alſo excellent againſt Sore Throats, being Gargled therewith, 'twill abate any Swelling, as <hi>Angina</hi>'s, <hi>Struma</hi>'s; 'tis alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent againſt the Inflamation of the Pallate of the Mouth, Uvula of the Throat, or Almonds of the Ears, which are then uſually ſaid to be fallen. 'Tis alſo prevalent againſt the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and to divert Rheums from the Eyes, by waſhing the Temples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; likewiſe to take away Tetters, Morphew, Itch or Scabs.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderfull alſo in internal uſes, being taken ſix or eight drops twice a day in the uſual drink, or before
<pb facs="tcp:154370:123"/>each Meal, it doth not only cure the Scurvy in the Mouth, but alſo any Scorbutick humour whereſoever; it ſweetens the Breath, prevents Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, frees the Body from Rheums, opens Obſtructions, cures tickling Coughs and harſhneſs, abates the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat and thirſt in Feavers, beyond many other Remedies; 'tis prevalent in the Strangury, Chollick, and Arthritical pains; and by its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent abſtertive quality cleanſes the Body from that, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of many Diſeaſes, taking off the very bud of Putrifaction both in Young and Old. In fine, I recommend this Spirit to the World from Experience as an excellent interval and external Remedy, demonſtrating thoſe Virtues attributed to it, and that it is not to be parallel'd by any ſhort of its own Ens.</p>
            <p>Now for a Concluſion of this Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, I thought it neceſſary to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe all that are deſirous to be ſatisfy'd in any point herein contained, that the Author will be very ready to lend his aid for that end, with this Proviſo, that what Letters are ſent by Poſt may
<pb facs="tcp:154370:124"/>be paid, otherwiſe I ſhall not be free to receive them, becauſe the Expence, that hath been of late, hath been ſo great about Nice Queries, which if continued would ſink a conſiderable Sum of Money, to the Authors great Detriment; but from ſuch that I teach any part of the <hi>Chimical</hi> or <hi>Spagiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art,</hi> whether according to the <hi>Schrodarian, Carteſian</hi> or <hi>Helmontian</hi> way, may be free, as being a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, wherein I am paid for my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Time, or Expence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
